aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvQXV0aXNt,Autism is a disorder of neural development characterized by impaired social interaction and communication and by restricted and repetitive behavior The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent before a child is three years old Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize how this occurs is not well understood It is one of three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum ASDs the other two being Asperger syndrome which lacks delays in cognitive development and language and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified commonly abbreviated as PDDNOS which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met Autism has a strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations or by rare combinations of common genetic variants In rare cases autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes such as heavy metals pesticides or childhood vaccines the vaccine hypotheses are biologically implausible and lack convincing scientific evidence The prevalence of autism is about 12 per 1000 people worldwide and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC report 20 per 1000 children in the United States are diagnosed with ASD up from 11 per 1000 in 2008 The number of people diagnosed with autism has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s partly due to changes in diagnostic practice and governmentsubsidized financial incentives for named diagnoses the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their childs life The signs usually develop gradually but some autistic children first develop more normally and then regress Early behavioral or cognitive intervention can help autistic children gain selfcare social and communication skills Although there is no known cure there have been reported cases of children who recovered Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood though some become successful An autistic culture has developed with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder CharacteristicsAutism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder that first appears during infancy or childhood and generally follows a steady course without remission Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood although often in more muted form It is distinguished not by a single symptom but by a characteristic triad of symptoms impairments in social interaction impairments in communication and restricted interests and repetitive behavior Other aspects such as atypical eating are also common but are not essential for diagnosis Autisms individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits Social developmentSocial deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders ASD see Classification from other developmental disorders People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted Noted autistic Temple Grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals or people with normal neural development as leaving her feeling like an anthropologist on Mars Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli smile and look at others less often and respond less to their own name Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms for example they have less eye contact and turn taking and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves such as the deficiency to point at things Three to fiveyearold autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding approach others spontaneously imitate and respond to emotions communicate nonverbally and take turns with others However they do form attachments to their primary caregivers Most autistic children display moderately less attachment security than nonautistic children although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition For further information on facial recognition and processing in individuals with ASD see the autism and facial recognition section of face perceptionChildren with highfunctioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to nonautistic peers despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism For them the quality of friendships not the number of friends predicts how lonely they feel Functional friendships such as those resulting in invitations to parties may affect the quality of life more deeply There are many anecdotal reports but few systematic studies of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD The limited data suggest that in children with mental retardation autism is associated with aggression destruction of property and tantrums A 2007 study interviewed parents of 67 children with ASD and reported that about twothirds of the children had periods of severe tantrums and about onethird had a history of aggression with tantrums significantly more common than in nonautistic children with language impairments A 2008 Swedish study found that of individuals aged 15 or older discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of ASD those who committed violent crimes were significantly more likely to have other psychopathological conditions such as psychosis CommunicationAbout a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life and may include delayed onset of babbling unusual gestures diminished responsiveness and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver In the second and third years autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling consonants words and word combinations their gestures are less often integrated with words Autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences and are more likely to simply repeat others words echolalia or reverse pronouns Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD for example they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointedat object and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience Autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language In a pair of studies highfunctioning autistic children aged 815 performed equally well as and adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language comprehension and inference As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends Repetitive behaviorAutistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior which the Repetitive Behavior ScaleRevised RBSR categorizes as followsA young boy with autism who has arranged his toys in a row Stereotypy is repetitive movement such as hand flapping head rolling or body rocking Compulsive behavior is intended and appears to follow rules such as arranging objects in stacks or lines Sameness is resistance to change for example insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted Ritualistic behavior involves an unvarying pattern of daily activities such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors  Restricted behavior is limited in focus interest or activity such as preoccupation with a single television program toy or game Selfinjury includes movements that injure or can injure the person such as eye poking skin picking hand biting and head banging A 2007 study reported that selfinjury at some point affected about 30 of children with ASD No single repetitive or selfinjurious behavior seems to be specific to autism but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors Other symptomsAutistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis but that can affect the individual or the family This paper represents a consensus of representatives from nine professional and four parent organizations in the US An estimated 05 to 10 of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention relative to the general population Sensory abnormalities are found in over 90 of those with autism and are considered core features by some although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders Differences are greater for underresponsivity for example walking into things than for overresponsivity for example distress from loud noises or for sensation seeking for example rhythmic movements An estimated 6080 of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone poor motor planning and toe walking deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper Unusual eating behavior occurs in about threequarters of children with ASD to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator Selectivity is the most common problem although eating rituals and food refusal also occur this does not appear to result in malnutrition Although some children with autism also have gastrointestinal GI symptoms there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that autistic children have more or different GI symptoms than usual studies report conflicting results and the relationship between GI problems and ASD is unclear Parents of children with ASD have higher levels of stress Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with Down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship However they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with Down syndrome siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative wellbeing and poorer sibling relationships as adults ClassificationAutism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders PDD which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior These symptoms do not imply sickness fragility or emotional disturbance Of the five PDD forms Asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes PDD not otherwise specified PDDNOS also called atypical autism is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder Unlike with autism people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development The terminology of autism can be bewildering with autism Asperger syndrome and PDDNOS often called the autism spectrum disorders ASD or sometimes the autistic disorders whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder childhood autism or infantile autism In this article autism refers to the classic autistic disorder in clinical practice though autism ASD and PDD are often used interchangeably ASD in turn is a subset of the broader autism phenotype which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autisticlike traits such as avoiding eye contact The manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum ranging from individuals with severe impairmentswho may be silent mentally disabled and locked into hand flapping and rockingto high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches narrowly focused interests and verbose pedantic communication Because the behavior spectrum is continuous boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low medium or highfunctioning autism LFA MFA and HFA based on IQ thresholds or on how much support the individual requires in daily life these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial Autism can also be divided into syndromal and nonsyndromal autism the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound mental retardation or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms such as tuberous sclerosis Although individuals with Asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism the extent of the overlap between Asperger syndrome HFA and nonsyndromal autism is unclear Validity of ASD subtypes  Some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills as opposed to a failure to make progress typically from 15 to 30 months of age The validity of this distinction remains controversial it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype A partial update is in or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression Research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry psychology neurology and pediatrics Newer technologies such as fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes observable traits that can be viewed on brain scans to help further neurogenetic studies of autism one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior CausesIt has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic cognitive and neural levels for autisms characteristic triad of symptoms However there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often cooccur Deletion 1 duplication 2 and inversion 3 are all chromosome abnormalities that have been implicated in autism Autism has a strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes the environment and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA but are heritable and influence gene expression Studies of twins suggest that heritability is 07 for autism and as high as 09 for ASD and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population However most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified Typically autism cannot be traced to a Mendelian singlegene mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASDs have been shown to selectively cause ASD Numerous candidate genes have been located with only small effects attributable to any particular gene The large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from copy number variationsspontaneous deletions or duplications in genetic material during meiosis Hence a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited that is the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome Several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism Some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways such as those involved with cell adhesion Gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activitydependent changes All known teratogens agents that cause birth defects related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later it is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development Although evidence for other environmental causes is anecdotal and has not been confirmed by reliable studies extensive searches are underway Environmental factors that have been claimed to contribute to or exacerbate autism or may be important in future research include certain foods infectious disease heavy metals solvents diesel exhaust PCBs phthalates and phenols used in plastic products pesticides brominated flame retardants alcohol smoking illicit drugs vaccines and prenatal stress although no links have been found and some have been completely disprovenParents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination This has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine overload a vaccine preservative or the MMR vaccine for causing autism The latter theory was supported by a litigationfunded study that has since been shown to have been an elaborate fraud Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries and the preventable deaths of several children Vaccines and autism     MechanismAutisms symptoms result from maturationrelated changes in various systems of the brain How autism occurs is not well understood Its mechanism can be divided into two areas the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies PathophysiologyAutism affects the amygdala cerebellum and many other parts of the brain Unlike many other brain disorders such as Parkinsons autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular cellular or systems level it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways or is like intellectual disability a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms Autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product Neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autisms mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception This anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors Just after birth the brains of autistic children tend to grow faster than usual followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood It is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all autistic children It seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization Hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following An excess of neurons that causes local overconnectivity in key brain regions  Disturbed neuronal migration during early gestation  Unbalanced excitatoryinhibitory networks  Abnormal formation of synapses and dendritic spines for example by modulation of the neurexinneuroligin celladhesion system or by poorly regulated synthesis of synaptic proteins Disrupted synaptic development may also contribute to epilepsy which may explain why the two conditions are associated Interactions between the immune system and the nervous system begin early during the embryonic stage of life and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response Aberrant immune activity during critical periods of neurodevelopment is possibly part of the mechanism of some forms of ASD Although some abnormalities in the immune system have been found in specific subgroups of autistic individuals it is not known whether these abnormalities are relevant to or secondary to autisms disease processes As autoantibodies are found in conditions other than ASD and are not always present in ASD the relationship between immune disturbances and autism remains unclear and controversial The relationship of neurochemicals to autism is not well understood several have been investigated with the most evidence for the role of serotonin and of genetic differences in its transport The role of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR in the pathogenesis of fragile X syndrome the most common identified genetic cause of autism has led to interest in the possible implications for future autism research into this pathway Some data suggest an increase in several growth hormones other data argue for diminished growth factors Also some inborn errors of metabolism are associated with autism but probably account for less than 5 of cases The mirror neuron system MNS theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autisms core features of social impairment and communication difficulties The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action The MNS may contribute to an individuals understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions intentions and emotions MNS and autism  Several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in MNS regions of individuals with ASD delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with Asperger syndrome and a correlation between reduced MNS activity and severity of the syndrome in children with ASD However individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the MNS and the MNS theory does not explain the normal performance of autistic children on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object Autistic individuals tend to use different areas of the brain yellow for a movement task compared to a control group blue ASDrelated patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks In autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the default network a largescale brain network involved in social and emotional processing with intact connectivity of the taskpositive network used in sustained attention and goaldirected thinking In people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks possibly reflecting a disturbance of selfreferential thought A 2008 brainimaging study found a specific pattern of signals in the cingulate cortex which differs in individuals with ASD The underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning highlevel neural connections and synchronization along with an excess of lowlevel processes Evidence for this theory has been found in functional neuroimaging studies on autistic individuals and by a brainwave study that suggested that adults with ASD have local overconnectivity in the cortex and weak functional connections between the frontal lobe and the rest of the cortex Other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each hemisphere of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the association cortex From studies based on eventrelated potentials transient changes to the brains electrical activity in response to stimuli there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention orientiation to auditory and visual stimuli novelty detection language and face processing and information storage several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli For example magnetoencephalography studies have found evidence in autistic children of delayed responses in the brains processing of auditory signals In the genetic area relations have been found between autism and schizophrenia based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with 1q211 deletion syndrome Research on autismschizophrenia relations for chromosome 15 15q133 chromosome 16 16p131 and chromosome 17 17p12 are inconclusive NeuropsychologyTwo major categories of cognitive theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behaviorThe first category focuses on deficits in social cognition The empathizingsystemizing theory postulates that autistic individuals can systemizethat is they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brainbut are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents An extension the extreme male brain theory hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing this extension is controversial as many studies contradict the idea that baby boys and girls respond differently to people and objects These theories are somewhat related to the earlier theory of mind approach which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by autistic childrens atypical responses to the SallyAnne test for reasoning about others motivations and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in Pathophysiology maps well to the hypothesis However most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals ability to understand other peoples basic intentions or goals instead data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others viewpoints The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing the executive functions such as working memory planning inhibition In his review Kenworthy states that the claim of executive dysfunction as a causal factor in autism is controversial however it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence but performance never reaches typical adult levels A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young autistic children Weak central coherence theory hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people A related theoryenhanced perceptual functioningfocuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autismNeither category is satisfactory on its own social cognition theories poorly address autisms rigid and repetitive behaviors while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful ScreeningAbout half of parents of children with ASD notice their childs unusual behaviors by age 18 months and about fourfifths notice by age 24 months According to an article in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders failure to meet any of the following milestones is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations Delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the longterm outcome  No babbling by 12 months No gesturing pointing waving etc by 12 months No single words by 16 months No twoword spontaneous not just echolalic phrases by 24 months Any loss of any language or social skills at any ageUS and Japanese practice is to screen all children for ASD at 18 and 24 months using autismspecific formal

whiteness or reflected sunlight in turn from albus white is the diffuse reflectivity or reflecting power of a surface It is defined as the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it Being a dimensionless fraction it may also be expressed as a percentage and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflecting power of a perfectly black surface to 1 for perfect reflection of a white surfaceAlbedo depends on the frequency of the radiation When quoted unqualified it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of visible light In general the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incoming radiation Exceptions are Lambertian surfaces which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function so their albedo does not depend on the incident distribution In practice a bidirectional reflectance distribution function BRDF may be required to characterize the scattering properties of a surface accurately although the albedo is a very useful first approximationThe albedo is an important concept in climatology and astronomy as well as in calculating reflectivity of surfaces in LEED sustainable rating systems for buildings The average overall albedo of Earth its planetary albedo is 30 to 35 because of the covering by clouds but varies widely locally across the surface depending on the geological and environmental features Environmental Encyclopedia 3rd ed Thompson Gale 2003 ISBN 0787654868 The term was introduced into optics by Johann Heinrich Lambert in his 1760 work PhotometriaTerrestrial albedo Sample albedos  Surface Typicalalbedo  Fresh asphalt 004  Worn asphalt 012  Conifer forestSummer 008 009 to 015  Deciduous trees 015 to 018  Bare soil 017  Green grass 025  Desert sand 040  New concrete 055  Ocean ice 0507  Fresh snow 080090 Albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to 09 for fresh snow to about 004 for charcoal one of the darkest substances Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body When seen from a distance the ocean surface has a low albedo as do most forests whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms Most land areas are in an albedo range of 01 to 04 The average albedo of the Earth is about 03 This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of cloudsHuman activities have changed the albedo via forest clearance and farming for example of various areas around the globe However quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficultThe classic example of albedo effect is the snowtemperature feedback If a snowcovered area warms and the snow melts the albedo decreases more sunlight is absorbed and the temperature tends to increase The converse is also true if snow forms a cooling cycle happens The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of insolation for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics20032004 mean annual clearsky and totalsky albedoThe Earths surface albedo is regularly estimated via Earth observation satellite sensors such as NASAs MODIS instruments on board the Terra and Aqua satellites As the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite a mathematical model of the BRDF is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directionalhemispherical reflectance and bihemispherical reflectance eg The Earths average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about 15 C If the Earth was frozen entirely and hence be more reflective the average temperature of the planet would drop below 40 C If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0 C In contrast if all the ice on Earth were to melta socalled aquaplanetthe average temperature on the planet would rise to just under 27 C Whitesky and blacksky albedoIt has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms the directionalhemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle  and the bihemispherical reflectance the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination Albedo can then be given asDirectionalhemispherical reflectance is sometimes referred to as blacksky albedo and bihemispherical reflectance as whitesky albedo These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface Astronomical albedoThe albedos of planets satellites and asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties The study of albedos their dependence on wavelength lighting angle phase angle and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of photometry For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos For example the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties while unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metallic content in asteroidsEnceladus a moon of Saturn has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar system with 99 of EM radiation reflected Another notable highalbedo body is Eris with an albedo of 096  Many small objects in the outer solar system and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about 005 A typical comet nucleus has an albedo of 004 Such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compoundsThe overall albedo of the Moon is around 012 but it is strongly directional and nonLambertian displaying also a strong opposition effect While such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodiesTwo common albedos that are used in astronomy are the Vband geometric albedo measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer and the Bond albedo measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected Their values can differ significantly which is a common source of confusionIn detailed studies the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five Hapke parameters which semiempirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfacesThe correlation between astronomical geometric albedo absolute magnitude and diameter is where is the astronomical albedo is the diameter in kilometers and H is the absolute magnitudeExamples of terrestrial albedo effectsIlluminationAlthough the albedotemperature effect is best known in colder whiter regions on Earth the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where yearround illumination is greater The maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere varying between 3 and 12 degrees north The minima are found in the subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination Smallscale effectsAlbedo works on a smaller scale too In sunlight dark clothes absorb more heat and lightcoloured clothes reflect it better thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing TreesBecause forests are generally attributed a low albedo as the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis it has been erroneously assumed that removing forests would lead to cooling on the grounds of increased albedo Through the evapotranspiration of water trees discharge excess heat from the forest canopy This water vapour rises resulting in cloud cover which also has a high albedo thereby further increasing the net global cooling effect attributable to forestsIn seasonally snowcovered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are 10 to 50 higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily Deciduous trees have an albedo value of about 015 to 018 whereas coniferous trees have a value of about 009 to 015 Studies by the Hadley Centre have investigated the relative generally warming effect of albedo change and cooling effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes eg Siberia were neutral or perhaps warming SnowSnow albedos can be as high as 09 this however is for the ideal example fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape Over Antarctica they average a little more than 08 If a marginally snowcovered area warms snow tends to melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt the icealbedo

Geographic June 2010 accessed July 8 2010 WaterWater reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the Fresnel equations see graphReflectivity of smooth water at 20 C refractive index1333At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner not diffusely The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this At small angles of incident light waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivityvsincidentangle curve and a locally increased average incident angle Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light it increases tremendously at high angles of incident light such as occur on the illuminated side of the Earth near the terminator early morning late afternoon and near the poles However as mentioned above waviness causes an appreciable reduction Since the light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident lightNote that white caps on waves look white and have high albedo because the water is foamed up so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect adding up their reflectivities Fresh black ice exhibits Fresnel reflectionCloudsCloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 08 On any given day about half of Earth is covered by clouds which reflect more sunlight than land and water Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10 C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies Aerosol effectsAerosols very fine particlesdroplets in the atmosphere have both direct and indirect effects on the Earths radiative balance The direct albedo effect is generally to cool the planet the indirect effect the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties is less certain As per the effects are Aerosol direct effect Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming Aerosol indirect effect Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo increased light scattering and radiative cooling first indirect effect but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud second indirect effectBlack carbonAnother albedorelated effect on the climate is from black carbon particles The size of this effect is difficult to quantify the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is 02 W m2 with a range 01 to 04 W m2 Other types of albedoSinglescattering albedo is used to define

Tuscaloosa University of Alabama Press 2001 ISBN 0817310657 HistoryEtymologyOne of the entrances to Russell Cave in Jackson County Charcoal from camp fires in the cave has been dated as early as 6550 to 6145 BCThe Alabama people a Muskogeanspeaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa Rivers on the upper reaches of the Alabama River served as the etymological source of the names of the river and state In the Alabama language the word for an Alabama person is Albaamo or variously Albaama or Albamo in different dialects the plural form Alabama persons is Albaamaha The word Alabama is believed to have originated from the Choctaw language and was later adopted by the Alabama tribe as their name The spelling of the word varies significantly between sources The first usage appears in three accounts of the Hernando de Soto expedition of 1540 with Garcilasso de la Vega using Alibamo while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote Alibamu and Limamu respectively As early as 1702 the tribe was known to the French as Alibamon with French maps identifying the river as Rivire des Alibamons Other spellings of the appellation have included Alibamu Alabamo Albama Alebamon Alibama Alibamou Alabamu and Allibamou The use of state names derived from Native American languages is common an estimated 27 states have names of Native American origin Although the origin of Alabama could be discerned sources disagree on its meaning An 1842 article in the Jacksonville Republican originated the idea that the meaning was Here We Rest This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of Alexander Beaufort Meek Experts in the Muskogean languages have been unable to find any evidence to support such a translation Scholars believe the word comes from the Choctaw alba meaning plants or weeds and amo meaning to cut to trim or to gather The meaning may have been clearers of the thicket or herb gatherers which may refer to clearing of land for cultivation or to collecting medicinal plants Alabama is but one of many place names in the state of Native American origin PreEuropean settlementIndigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before European colonization Trade with the Northeast via the Ohio River began during the Burial Mound Period 1000 BCAD 700 and continued until European contact The Moundville Archaeological Site in Hale County It was occupied by Native Americans of the Mississippian culture from 1000 AD to 1450 ADThe agrarian Mississippian culture covered most of the state from AD 1000 to 1600 with one of its major centers being at the Moundville Archaeological Site in Moundville Alabama Analysis of artifacts recovered from archaeological excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars formulating the characteristics of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex SECC Contrary to popular belief the SECC appears to have no direct links to Mesoamerican culture but developed independently The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood Among the historical tribes of Native American people living in the area of presentday Alabama at the time of European contact were Iroquoianspeaking Cherokee and the Muskogeanspeaking Alabama Alibamu Chickasaw Choctaw Creek and Koasati European settlementFrench map from 1725 showing the Plan Profile and Elevation of Fort Cond at MobileThe French founded the first European settlement in the region at Old Mobile in 1702 The city was moved to the current site of Mobile in 1711 This area was French from 1702 to 1763 part of British West Florida from 1763 to 1783 and split between the United States and Spain from 1783 to 1821 Thomas Bassett a loyalist to the British monarchy was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside of the Mobile area He settled in the Tombigbee settlements in what is now Washington County during the early 1770s What is now the counties of Baldwin and Mobile became part of Spanish West Florida in 1783 part of the independent Republic of West Florida in 1810 and was finally added to the Mississippi Territory in 1812 The area making up todays northern and central Alabama and Mississippi then known as the Yazoo lands had been claimed by the Province of Georgia after 1767 Following the Revolutionary War it remained a part of Georgia although heavily disputed Cadle Farris W Georgia Land Surveying History and Law 1991 Athens Ga University of Georgia Press Map showing the formation of the Mississippi and Alabama territoriesWith the exception of the immediate area around Mobile and the Yazoo lands what is now central Alabama was made part of the Mississippi Territory upon its creation in 1798 The Yazoo lands were added to the territory in 1804 following the Yazoo land scandal Spain had kept a governmental presence in Mobile after 1812 When Andrew Jacksons forces occupied Mobile in 1814 he demonstrated the United States de facto authority over the region which effectively ended Spanish influence although not its claim while gaining an unencumbered passage to the Gulf of Mexico from the hinterlands of the territory Prior to the admission of Mississippi as a state on December 10 1817 the more sparsely settled

Constitutional Convention of Alabama after it was approved to become the 22nd state From July 5 to August 2 1819 delegates met to prepare the new state constitution Huntsville served as the temporary capital of Alabama from 1819 to 1820 when the seat of state government was moved to Cahaba in Dallas County Cahaba now a ghost town was the first permanent state capital from 1820 to 1825 Alabama Fever was already underway when the state was admitted to the Union with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation Part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men Southeastern planters and traders from the Upper South brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in Alabama expanded The economy of the central Black Belt named for its dark productive soil was built around large cotton plantations whose owners wealth grew largely from slave labor The area also drew many poor disfranchised people who became subsistence farmers Alabama had a population estimated at under 10000 people in 1810 but it had increased to more than 300000 people by 1830 Most Native American tribes were completely removed from the state within a few years of the passage of the Indian Removal Act by Congress in 1830 The main house built 1833 at Thornhill a Black Belt plantationFrom 1826 to 1846 Tuscaloosa served as the capital of Alabama On January 30 1846 the Alabama legislature announced that it had voted to remove the capital city from Tuscaloosa to Montgomery The first legislative session in the new capital met in December 1847 A new capitol building was erected under the direction of Stephen Decatur Button of Philadelphia The first structure burned down in 1849 but was rebuilt on the same site in 1851 This second capitol building in Montgomery remains to the present day It was designed by Barachias Holt of Exeter Maine By 1860 the population had increased to a total of 964201 people of which 435080 were enslaved African Americans and 2690 were free people of color Civil War and ReconstructionUnion Army troops occupying Courthouse Square in

joined the Confederate States of America The Confederacys capital was initially located at Montgomery Although comparatively few battles were fought in the state Alabama contributed about 120000 soldiers to the American Civil War Alabamas slaves were freed by the 13th Amendment in 1865 A company of cavalry soldiers from Huntsville Alabama joined Nathan Bedford Forrests battalion in Hopkinsville Kentucky The company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves collar and coat tails This led to them being greeted with Yellowhammer and the name later was applied to all Alabama

until its official restoration to the Union in 1868 From 1867 to 1874 with most white citizens barred from voting many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African American congressmen Jeremiah Haralson Benjamin S Turner and James T Rapier The Alabama Legislature during Reconstruction in 1872Following the war the state was remained chiefly agricultural with an economy tied to cotton During Reconstruction state legislators ratified a new state constitution in 1868 that created a public school system for the first time and expanded womens rights Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation Organized resistance groups also tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans Besides the shortlived original Ku Klux Klan these included the Pale Faces Knights of the White Camellia Red Shirts and the White League Reconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874 when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governors office They wrote another constitution in 1875 and the legislature passed the Blaine Amendment prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious affiliated schools The same year legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools Railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891 More Jim Crow laws were passed at the beginning of the 20th century to enforce segregation in everyday life19001949The developing skyline of Birmingham in 1915The new 1901 Constitution of Alabama included electoral laws that effectively disfranchised African Americans and most poor whites through voting restrictions including poll taxes and literacy requirements J Morgan KousserThe Shaping of Southern Politics Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the OneParty South New Haven Yale University Press 1974 While the planter class had persuaded poor whites to support these legislative efforts the new restrictions resulted in their disfranchisement as well due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax In 1900 Alabama had more than 181000 African Americans eligible to vote By 1903 only 2980 had qualified to register although at least 74000 black voters were literate By 1941 more white Alabamians than black had been disfranchised 600000 whites

Autauga County Completed in 1919 it was one of the 387 Rosenwald Schools built in the state for African American childrenThe ruraldominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disfranchised African Americans but it did not relieve them of paying taxes Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South the Rosenwald Fund began funding the building of what came to be known as Rosenwald Schools In Alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds which paid onethird of the construction costs The local community and state paid the rest Beginning in 1913 the first 80 Rosenwald Schools were built in Alabama A total of 387 schools 7 teachers houses and several vocational buildings had been completed in the state by 1937 Several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places Continued racial discrimination agricultural depression and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans to seek opportunities in northern cities They left Alabama in the early 20th century as part of the Great Migration to industrial jobs and better futures in northern industrial cities The population growth rate in Alabama see Historical Populations table below dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920 reflecting this emigrationAt the same time many rural whites and blacks moved to the city of Birmingham to work in new industrial jobs Birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called The Magic City By the 1920s Birmingham was the 19th largest city in the United States and had more than 30 of the Alabamas population Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity not seen since before the Civil War Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living One example of this massive influx of workers can be shown by what happened in Mobile Between 1940 and 1943 more than 89000 people moved into the city to work for war effort industries Thomason Michael Mobile  the new history of Alabamas first city pages 213217 Tuscaloosa University of Alabama Press 2001 ISBN 0817310657

massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961 the ruraldominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas In addition the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside BirminghamOne result was that Jefferson County containing Birminghams industrial and economic powerhouse contributed more than onethird of all tax revenue to the state but did not receive a proportional amount in services Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination A minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature African Americans were presumed partial to Republicans for historical reasons but they were disfranchised White Alabamans felt bitter towards the Republican Party in the aftermath of the Civil War and Reconstruction These factors created a longstanding tradition that any candidate who wanted to be viable with white voters had to run as a Democrat regardless of political beliefsPhoto taken during the third Selma to Montgomery marchAlthough efforts had already started decades earlier African Americans began to more actively attempt to end the disfranchisement and segregation in the state during the 1950s and 1960s with the Civil Rights Movement These efforts directly led to the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 by the US Congress During the 1960s under Governor George Wallace failed attempts were made at the state level to resist federallysanctioned desegregation effortsDuring the Civil Rights Movement African Americans achieved a protection of voting and other civil rights through the passage of the national Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 Legal segregation ended in the states as Jim Crow laws were invalidated or repealed Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 cases were filed in Federal courts to force Alabama to redistrict by population both the House and Senate of the state legislature In 1972 for the first time since 1901 the legislature implemented the Alabama constitutions provision for periodic redistricting based on population This

statuette is officially named the Academy Award of Merit and is one of nine types of Academy Awards Organized and overseen by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences AMPAS the awards are given each year at a formal ceremony The AMPAS was originally conceived by MetroGoldwynMayer studio executive Louis B Mayer as a professional honorary organization to help improve the film industrys image and help mediate labor disputes The awards themselves were later initiated by the Academy as awards of merit for distinctive achievement in the industry The awards were first given in 1929 at a ceremony created for the awards at the Hotel Roosevelt in Hollywood Over the years that the award has been given the categories presented have changed currently Oscars are given in more than a dozen categories and include films of various types As one of the most prominent award ceremonies in the world the Academy Awards ceremony is televised live in more than 100 countries annually It is also the oldest award ceremony in the media its equivalents the Grammy Awards for music the Emmy Awards for television and the Tony Awards for theater are all modeled after the Academy AwardsThe 85th Academy Awards were held on Sunday February 24 2013 at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles California The 86th Academy Awards will be held on Sunday March 2 2014 at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles This will be a week later than normal as not to interfere with the 2014 Winter Olympics  History Gary Cooper and Joan Fontaine holding their Oscars at the Academy Awards 1942The first awards were presented on May 16 1929 at a private brunch at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel with an audience of about 270 people The post Academy Awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel The cost of guest tickets for that nights ceremony was 5 Fifteen statuettes were awarded honoring artists directors and other personalities of the filmmaking industry of the time for their works during the 19271928 periodWinners had been announced three months earlier however that was changed in the second ceremony of the Academy Awards in 1930 Since then and during the first decade the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11 pm on the night of the awards This method was used until the Los Angeles Times announced the winners before the ceremony began as a result the Academy has since 1941 used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners For the first six ceremonies the eligibility period spanned two calendar years For example the 2nd Academy Awards presented on April 3 1930 recognized films that were released between August 1 1928 and July 31 1929 Starting with the 7th Academy Awards held in 1935 the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31The first Best Actor awarded was Emil Jannings for his performances in The Last Command and The Way of All Flesh He had to return to Europe before the ceremony so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier this made him the first Academy Award winner in history The honored professionals were awarded for all the work done in a certain category for the qualifying period for example Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period Since the fourth ceremony the system changed and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film  a total of 2809 Oscars have been given for 1853 awards A total of 302 actors have won Oscars in competitive acting categories or have been awarded Honorary or Juvenile AwardsThe 1939 film Beau Geste is the only movie that features as many as four Academy Award winners for Best Actor in a Leading Role Gary Cooper Ray Milland Susan Hayward Broderick Crawford prior to any of the actors receiving the

Academy Scientific and Technical Award the Academy Award for Technical Achievement the John A Bonner Medal of Commendation and the Student Academy Award plus two awards that are not presented annually the Special Achievement Award in the form of an Oscar statuette and the Honorary Award that may or may not be in the form of an Oscar statuette the best known one is the Academy Award of Merit more popularly known as the Oscar statuette Made of goldplated britannium on a black metal base it is 135 in 34 cm tall weighs 85 lb 385 kg and depicts a knight rendered in Art Deco style holding a crusaders sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes The five spokes each represent the original branches of the Academy Actors Writers Directors Producers and Technicians In 1928 MGMs art director Cedric Gibbons one of the original Academy members supervised the design of the award trophy by printing the design on a scroll In need of a model for his statuette Gibbons was introduced by his future wife Dolores del Ro to Mexican film director and actor Emilio El Indio Fernndez Reluctant at first Fernndez was finally convinced to pose nude to create what today is known as the Oscar Then sculptor George Stanley who also did the Muse Fountain at the Hollywood Bowl sculpted Gibbonss design in clay and Sachin Smith cast the statuette in 925 percent tin and 75 percent copper and then goldplated it The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the CW Shumway  Sons Foundry in Batavia Illinois which also contributed to casting the molds for the Vince Lombardi Trophy and Emmy Awards statuettes Since 1983 approximately 50 Oscars are made each year in Chicago by Illinois manufacturer RS Owens  Company In support of the American effort in World War II the statuettes were made of plaster and were traded in for gold ones after the war had ended  Naming The origin of the name Oscar is disputed One biography of Bette Davis claims that she named the Oscar after her first husband band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson one of the earliest mentions in print of the term Oscar dates back to a Time magazine article about the 1934 6th Academy Awards Walt Disney is also quoted as thanking the Academy for his Oscar as early as 1932 Another claimed origin is that the Academys Executive Secretary Margaret Herrick first saw the award in 1931 and made reference to the statuettes reminding her of her Uncle Oscar a nickname for her cousin Oscar Pierce Oscar in The Oxford English Dictionary June 2008 Draft Revision Columnist Sidney Skolsky was present during Herricks naming and seized the name in his byline Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette Oscar Levy Emanuel 2003

anything to declare and reputedly replied I have nothing to declare but my genius  Ownership of Oscar statuettes Since 1950 the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the Academy for US1 If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation then the Academy keeps the statuette Academy Awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for sixfigure sums Levy 2003 pg 28 In December 2011 Orson Welles sole 1941 Oscar for Citizen Kane

recipient it is essentially not on the open market  Michael Todds grandson tried to sell Todds Oscar statuette to a movie prop collector in 1989 but the Academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction Although some Oscar sales transactions have been successful some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy which keeps them in its treasury Levy 2003 pg 29  Nomination Since 2004 Academy Award nomination results have been announced to the public in late January Prior to that the results were announced in early February Voters The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences AMPAS a professional honorary organization maintains a voting membership of 5783  Academy membership is divided into different branches with each representing a different discipline in film production Actors constitute the largest voting bloc numbering 1311 members 22 percent of the Academys composition Votes have been certified by the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and its predecessor Price Waterhouse for the past 73 annual awards ceremonies All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contribution to the field of motion picturesNew membership proposals are considered annually The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join The 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6000 voting members While the membership had been growing stricter policies have kept its size steady since then In May 2011 the Academy sent a letter advising its 6000 or so voting members that an online system for Oscar voting will be implemented in 2013  Rules According to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules a film must open in the previous calendar year from midnight at the start of January 1 to midnight at the end of December 31 in Los Angeles County California to qualify except for the Best Foreign Language Film For example the 2009 Best Picture winner The Hurt Locker was actually first released in 2008 but did not qualify for the 2008 awards as it did not play its Oscarqualifying run in Los Angeles until mid2009 thus qualifying for the 2009 awardsRule 2 states that a film must be featurelength defined as a minimum of 40 minutes except for short subject awards and it must exist either on a 35 mm or 70 mm film print or in 24 frames or 48 frames progressive scan digital cinema format with native resolution not less than 1280x720Producers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year The form includes the production credits for all related categories Then each form is checked and put in a Reminder List of Eligible ReleasesIn late December ballots and copies of the Reminder List of Eligible Releases are mailed to around 6000 active members For most categories members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories ie only directors vote for directors writers for writers actors for actors etc There are some exceptions in the case of certain categories like Foreign Film Documentary and Animated Feature Film in which movies are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches In the special case of Best Picture all voting members are eligible to select the nominees for that category Foreign films must include English subtitles and each country can submit only one film per year The members of the various branches nominate those in their respective fields while all members may submit nominees for Best Picture The winners are then determined by a second round of voting in which all members are then allowed to vote in most categories including Best Picture  Ceremony  Telecast 31st Academy Awards Presentations Pantages Theater Hollywood 195981st Academy Awards Presentations Kodak Theater Hollywood 2009The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony most commonly in late February or early March following the relevant calendar year and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees It is the culmination of the film awards season which usually begins during November or December of the previous year This is an elaborate extravaganza with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day Black tie dress is the most common outfit for men although fashion may dictate not wearing a bowtie and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcastThe Academy Awards is televised live across the United States excluding Hawaii they aired live in Alaska starting in 2011 for the first time since 1996 Canada the United Kingdom and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world The 2007 ceremony was watched by more than 40 million Americans Nielsen  Press Release The Nielsen Companys 2008 Guide to the Academy Awards Other awards ceremonies such as the Emmys Golden Globes and Grammys are broadcast live in the East Coast but are on tape delay in the West Coast and might not air on the same day outside North America if the awards are even televised The Academy has for several years claimed that the award show has up to a billion viewers internationally but this has so far not been confirmed by any independent sourcesThe Awards show was first televised on NBC in 1953 NBC continued to broadcast the event until 1960 when the ABC Network took over televising the festivities through 1970 after which NBC resumed the broadcasts ABC once again took over broadcast duties in 1976 it is under contract to do so through the year 2020 After more than 60 years of being held in late March or early April the ceremonies were moved up to late February or early March starting in 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with Oscar season in the film industry Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success of the NCAA Mens Division I Basketball Championship which would cut into the Academy Awards audience The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February sweeps period Some years the ceremony is moved into early March in deference to the Winter Olympics Advertising is somewhat restricted however as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast The Awards show holds the distinction of having won the most Emmys in history with 47 wins and 195 nominations After many years of being held on Mondays at 900 pm Eastern600 pm Pacific in 1999 the ceremonies were moved to Sundays at 830 pm Eastern530 pm Pacific The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays that Los Angeles rushhour traffic jams could be avoided and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier Academy Awards will move to Sunday night Reading Eagle  July 1 1998 From Google News Archive For many years the film industry had opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office Never Say Never Academy Awards move to Sunday The Item  March 19 1999 From Google News Archive On March 30 1981 the awards ceremony was postponed for one day after the shooting of President Ronald Reagan and others in Washington DCIn 1993 an In Memoriam segment was introduced honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months a selection compiled by a small committee of Academy members This segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some namesIn 2010 the organizers of the Academy Awards announced that winners acceptance speeches must not run past 45 seconds This according to organizer Bill Mechanic was to ensure the elimination of what he termed the single most hated thing on the show  overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion The Academy has also had recent discussions about moving the ceremony even further back into January citing TV viewers fatigue with the film industrys long awards season But such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail Also a January ceremony may have to compete with National Football

in 1949 were held at the Academy Award Theater at what was the Academys headquarters on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood From 1950 to 1960 the awards were presented at Hollywoods Pantages Theatre With the advent of television the 19531957 awards took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York first at the NBC International Theatre 1953 and then at the NBC Century Theatre 19541957 after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles The Oscars moved to the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in Santa Monica California in 1961 By 1969 the Academy decided to move the ceremonies back to Los Angeles this time to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Los Angeles County Music CenterIn 2002 the Kodak Theatre became the permanent home of the award ceremonies However due to Eastman Kodaks bankruptcy issues this theatre was renamed the Hollywood and Highland Center in the days preceding the February 26 2012 awards ceremony As of May 2012 the theatre was once again renamed  to the Dolby

and prestige of the Academy Awards studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the Oscar season This has generated accusations of the Academy Awards being influenced more by marketing than quality William Friedkin an Academy Awardwinning film director and former producer of the ceremony expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in 2009 describing it as the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself In addition some winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars The first to do so was Dudley Nichols Best Writing in 1935 for The Informer Nichols boycotted the 8th Academy Awards ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writers Guild George C Scott became the second person to refuse his award Best Actor in 1970 for Patton at the 43rd Academy Awards ceremony Scott described it as a meat parade saying I dont want any part of it The third winner Marlon Brando refused his award Best Actor in 1972 for The Godfather citing the film industrys discrimination and mistreatment of Native Americans At the 45th Academy Awards ceremony Brando sent Sacheen Littlefeather to read a 15page speech detailing his criticisms Tim Dirks editor of AMCs filmsiteorg has written of the Academy AwardsActing prizes

aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbF9BdG9taWNfVGltZQ==,International Atomic Time TAI from the French name Temps atomique international Temps atomique 1975 is a highprecision atomic coordinate httpadsabsharvardeducgibinnphbibquerybibcode1986CeMec38155G time standard based on the notional passage of proper time on Earths geoid It is the basis for Coordinated Universal Time UTC which is used for civil timekeeping all over the Earths surface and for Terrestrial Time which is used for astronomical calculations Since 30 June 2012 when the last leap second was added TAI has been exactly 35 seconds ahead of UTC The 35 seconds results from the initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972 plus 25 leap seconds in UTC since 1972Time coordinates on the TAI scales are conventionally specified using traditional means of specifying days carried over from nonuniform time standards based on the rotation of the Earth Specifically both Julian Dates and the Gregorian calendar are used TAI in this form was synchronised with Universal Time at the beginning of 1958 and the two have drifted apart ever since due to the changing motion of the EarthOperation TAI as a time scale is a weighted average of the time kept by over 200 atomic clocks in over 50 national laboratories worldwide BIPM  International Atomic Time nd The clocks are compared using GPS signals and twoway satellite time and frequency transfer Circular T 2009 Due to the averaging it is far more stable than any clock would be alone see signal averaging for a discussion The majority of the clocks are caesium clocks the definition of the SI second is written in terms of caesium McCarthy Seidelmann 2009 207 214 The participating institutions each broadcast in real time a frequency signal with time codes which is their estimate of TAI Time codes are usually published in the form of UTC which differs from TAI by a wellknown integer number of seconds These time scales are denoted in the form UTCNPL in the UTC form where NPL in this case identifies the National Physical Laboratory UK The TAI form may be denoted TAINPL The latter is not to be confused with TANPL which denotes an independent atomic time scale not synchronised to TAI or to anything elseThe clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other The International Bureau of Weights and Measures BIPM France combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible This combined time scale is published monthly in Circular T and is the canonical TAI This time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences UTCUTCk equivalent to TAITAIk for each participating institution k The same circular also gives tables of TAITAk for the various unsynchronised atomic time scalesErrors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty Circular T or by errata in a subsequent Circular T Aside from this once published in Circular T the TAI scale is not revised In hindsight it is possible to discover errors in TAI and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale Doing so does not create another version of TAI it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of Terrestrial Time TTHistoryEarly atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock the atomic clocks were not operated continuously Atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955 using the first caesium atomic clock at the National Physical Laboratory UK NPL The Greenwich Atomic GA scale began in 1955 at the Royal Greenwich Observatory The International Time Bureau BIH began a time scale Tm or AM in July 1955 using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of VLF radio signals The United States Naval Observatory began the A1 scale 13 September 1956 using an Atomichron commercial atomic clock followed by the NBSA scale at the National Bureau of Standards Boulder Colorado Both the BIH scale and A1 was defined by an epoch at the beginning of 1958 it was set to read Julian Date 24362045 1 January 1958 000000 at the corresponding UT2 instant The procedures used by the BIH evolved and the name for the time scale changed A3 in 1963 and TABIH in 1969 McCarthy  Seidelmann 2009 199ndash201 This synchronisation was inevitably imperfect depending as it did on the astronomical realisation of UT2 At the time UT2 as published by various observatories differed by several hundredths of a secondIn 1961 UTC began UTC is a discontinuous time scale composed from segments that are linear transformations of atomic time the discontinuities being arranged so that UTC approximated UT2 until the end of 1971 and UT1 thereafter This was a compromise arrangement for a broadcast time scale a linear transformation of the BIHs atomic time meant that the time scale was stable and internationally synchronised while approximating UT1 means that tasks such as navigation which require a source of Universal Time continue to be well served by public time broadcasts McCarthy  Seidelmann 2009 227ndash9 The SI second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in 1967 and in 1971 it was renamed International Atomic Time TAI McCarthy  Seidelmann 2009 202ndash4 In the 1970s it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to gravitational time dilation and the combined TAI scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks Starting from Julian Date 24431445 1 January 1977 000000 corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks so that TAI would correspond to proper time at mean sea level the geoid Because the clocks had been on average well above sea level this meant that TAI slowed down by about 1012 The former uncorrected time scale continues to be published under the name EAL Echelle Atomique Libre meaning Free Atomic Scale McCarthy  Seidelmann 215 The instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for Barycentric Coordinate Time TCB Geocentric Coordinate Time TCG and Terrestrial Time TT All three of these time scales were defined to read JD 24431445003725 1 January 1977 000032184 exactly at that instant The offset is to provide continuity with the older Ephemeris Time TAI was henceforth a realisation of TT with the equation TTTAI  TAI  32184 s McCarthy  Seidelmann 218ndash9 The continued existence of TAI was questioned in a 2007 letter from the BIPM to the ITUR which stated In the case of a redefinition of UTC without leap seconds the CCTF would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing TAI as it would remain parallel to the continuous UTC CCTF

aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvQWx0cnVpc20=,Giving alms to the poor is often considered an altruistic action in many cultures and religionsAltruism or selflessness is the principle or practice of concern for the welfare of others It is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions though the concept of others toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions Altruism or selflessness is the opposite of selfishnessAltruism can be distinguished from feelings of duty and loyalty Altruism is a motivation to provide something of value to a party who must be anyone but ones self while duty focuses on a moral obligation towards a specific individual eg a god a king or collective eg a government Pure altruism consists of sacrificing something for someone other than the self eg sacrificing time energy or possessions with no expectation of any compensation or benefits either direct or indirect eg receiving recognition for the act of giving Much debate exists as to whether true altruism is possible The theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification The validity of this argument depends on whether intrinsic rewards qualify as benefits The term altruism may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others Used in this sense its usually contrasted to egoism which is defined as acting to the benefit of ones selfThe notion of altruismThe concept has a long history in philosophical and ethical thought The term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science Auguste Comte and has become a major topic for psychologists especially evolutionary psychology researchers evolutionary biologists and ethologists Whilst ideas about altruism from one field can have an impact on the other fields the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism In simple terms altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help themScientific viewpointsAnthropologyMarcel Mausss book The Gift contains a passage Note on alms This note describes the evolution of the notion of alms and by extension of altruism from the notion of sacrifice In it he writesAlms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one handand of a notion of sacrifice on the other Generosity is an obligation because Nemesisavenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealthof certain people who should rid themselves of it This is the ancient morality of thegift which has become a principle of justice The gods and the spirits accept thatthe share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had beenhitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children Compare Altruism ethics  perception of altruism as selfsacrifice Compare explanation of alms in various scripturesEvolutionary explanationsGiving alms to beggar childrenIn the science of ethology the study of animal behaviour and more generally in the study of social evolution altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor In evolutionary psychology this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity emergency aid help to coalition partners tipping courtship gifts production of public goods and environmentalism Pat Barcaly The evolution of charitable behaviour and the power of reputation In Theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins Two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from game theorySome of the proposed mechanisms are Kin selection That animals and humans are more altruistic towards close kin than to distant kin and nonkin has been confirmed in numerous studies across many different cultures Even subtle cues indicating kinship may unconsciously increase altruistic behavior One kinship cue is facial resemblance One study found that slightly altering photographs so that they more closely resembled the faces of study participants increased the trust the participants expressed regarding depicted persons Another cue is having the same family name especially if rare and this has been found to increase helping behavior Another study found more cooperative behavior the greater the number the perceived kin in a group Using kinship terms in political speeches increased audience agreement with the speaker in one study This effect was especially strong for firstborns who are typically close to their families  Vested interests People are likely to suffer if their friends allies and similar social ingroups suffer or even disappear Helping such group members may therefore eventually benefit the altruist Making ingroup membership more noticeable increases cooperativeness Extreme selfsacrifice towards the ingroup may be adaptive if a hostile outgroup threatens to kill the entire ingroup  Reciprocal altruism See also Reciprocity evolution Direct reciprocity Research shows that it can be beneficial to help others if there is a chance that they can and will reciprocate the help The effective tit for tat strategy is one game theoretic example Many people seem to be following a similar strategy by cooperating if and only if others cooperate in return One consequence is that people are more cooperative if it is more likely that individuals will interact again in the future People tend to be less cooperative if they perceive that the frequency of helpers in the population is lower They tend to help less if they see noncooperativeness by others and this effect tend to be stronger than the opposite effect of seeing cooperative behaviors Simply changing the cooperative framing of a proposal may increase cooperativeness such as calling it a Community Game instead of a Wall Street Game A tendency towards reciprocity implies that people will feel obligated to respond if someone helps them This has been used by charities that give small gifts to potential donors hoping thereby to induce reciprocity Another method is to announce publicly that someone has given a large donation The tendency to reciprocate can even generalize so people become more helpful toward others in general after being helped On the other hand people will avoid or even retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating People sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended to or their helping may not be noticed which may cause unintended conflicts As such it may be an optimal strategy to be slightly forgiving of and have a slightly generous interpretation of noncooperation People are more likely to cooperate on a task if they can communicate with one another first This may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises They are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately Direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intragroup competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population Thus giving grades and promotions based only on an individuals performance relative to a small local group as is common may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group  Indirect reciprocity The avoidance of poor reciprocators and cheaters causes a persons reputation to become very important A person with a good reputation for reciprocity have a higher chance of receiving help even from persons they have had no direct interactions with previously  Strong reciprocity A form of reciprocity where some individuals seem to spend more resources on cooperating and punishing than would be most beneficial as predicted by several established theories of altruism A number of theories have been proposed as explanations as well as criticisms regarding its existence Pseudoreciprocity An organism behaves altruistically and the recipient does not reciprocate but has an increased chance of acting in a way that is selfish but also as a byproduct benefits the altruist Costly signaling and the handicap principle Since altruism takes away resources from the altruist it can be an honest signal of resource availability and the abilities needed to gather resources This may signal to others that the altruist is a valuable potential partner It may also be a signal of interactive and cooperative intentions since those not interacting further in the future gain nothing from the costly signaling It is unclear if costly signaling can indicate a longterm cooperative personality but people have increased trust for those who help Costly signaling is pointless if everyone has the same traits resources and cooperative intentions but become a potentially more important signal if the population increasingly varies on these characteristics Hunters widely sharing the meat has been seen as a costly signal of ability and research has found that good hunters have higher reproductive success and more adulterous relations even if they themselves receive no more of the hunted meat than anyone else Similarly holding large feasts and giving large donations has been seen as ways of demonstrating ones resources Heroic risktaking has also been interpreted as a costly signal of ability Volunteers assist Hurricane victims at the Houston Astrodome following Hurricane KatrinaBoth indirect reciprocity and costly signaling depend on the value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions One is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later is publicly announced is discussed or is simply being observed by someone else This have been documented in many studies The effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen Weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects Public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic People who know that they are publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of reputational concerns Wendy Iredal and Mark van Vugt Altruism as showing off a signaling perspective on promoting green behaviour and acts of kindness In Women have been found to find altruistic men to be attractive partners When looking for a longterm partner more conventional altruism may be preferred which may indicate that he is also willing to share resources with her and her children while when looking for a shortterm partner heroic risktaking which may be costly signal showing good genes may be more preferable Men also perform more altruistic acts in the early stages of a romantic relationship or simply when in the presence of an attractive woman While both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in a partner there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in presence of an attractive man Men may even avoid altruistic women in shortterm relationships which may be because they expect less success People may compete over getting the benefits of a high reputation which may cause competitive altruism On other hand in some experiments a proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous This may possibly be due to reasons such as psychopathy or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic The reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present While humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costsbenefits as compared to those in the present some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative Explicit extrinsic rewards and punishments have been found to sometimes actually have opposite effects on behaviors This may be because such extrinsic topdown incentives may undermine intrinsic and reputational incentives which overall may make the behaviors less desirable to do Another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them This may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists especially by those who are noncooperators A counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good at all  Group selection It has controversially been argued by some evolutionary scientists such as E O Wilson that natural selection can act at the level of nonkin groups to produce adaptations that benefit a nonkin group even if these adaptions are detrimental at the individual level Thus while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be outcompeted by less altruistic persons at the individual level according to group selection theory the opposite may occur at the group level where groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting of the less altruistic persons Such altruism may only extend to ingroup members while there may instead prejudice and antagonism against outgroup members See also ingroup favoritism Group selection theory has been criticized by many other evolutionary scientists Leon NeyfakhWhere does good come from April 17 2011 httpwwwbostoncombostonglobeideasarticles20110417wheredoesgoodcomefrom E O Wilson Biologist EO Wilson on Why Humans Like Ants Need a Tribe

are always consciously calculating how to increase their inclusive fitness when they are doing altruistic acts Instead evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms such as emotions that promote altruistic behaviors Every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment This need not imply that on average 50 or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits The benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups Research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to nokin to friends than to strangers to those attractive than to those unattractive to noncompetitors than to competitors and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind George R Prices development of the Price equation which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular slime moulds such as Dictyostelium mucoroides These protists live as individual amoebae until starved at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting bodySelective investment theory proposes that close social bonds and associated emotional cognitive and neurohormonal mechanisms evolved in order to facilitate longterm highcost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success Such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for leftwing politics such by the Russian zoologist and anarchist Peter Kropotkin in his 1902 book and Peter Singer in his book A Darwinian LeftMost recently Jeremy Griffith has proposed a biological theory for the development of truly altruistic instincts that accommodates the biological imperative to reproduce as evidenced by a moral conscience visible in humans today Griffith J 2011 Conscience In The Book of Real Answers to

provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging In their research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA in October 2006 Human frontomesolimbic networks guide decisions about charitable donation PNAS 2006103421562315628 they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic reward pathway a primitive part of the brain that usually lights up in response to food and sex However when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations another brain circuit was selectively activated the subgenual cortexseptal region These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species Altruism the experiment suggested was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain hardwired and pleasurable Another experiment funded by the National Institutes of Health and conducted in 2007 at the Duke University in Durham North Carolina suggests a different view that altruistic behavior may originate from how people view the world rather than how they act in it Brain Scan Predicts Difference Between Altruistic And Selfish People In the study published in the February 2007 print issue of Nature Neuroscience researchers have found a part of the brain that behaves differently for altruistic and selfish peopleThe researchers invited 45 volunteers to play a computer game and also to watch the computer play the game In some rounds the game resulted in the volunteers winning money for themselves and in others it resulted in money being donated to a charity of the volunteers choice During these activities the researchers took functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI scans of the participants brains and were surprised by the results Although they were expecting to see activity in the brains reward centers based on the idea that people perform altruistic acts because they feel good about it what they found was that another part of the brain was also involved and it was quite sensitive to the difference between doing something for personal gain and doing it for someone elses gain That part of the brain is called the posterior superior temporal cortex pSTCIn the next stage the scientists asked the participants some questions about type and frequency of their altruistic or helping behaviours They then analysed the responses to generate an estimate of a persons tendency to act altruistically and compared each persons level of altruism against their fMRI brain scan The results showed that pSTC activity rose in proportion to a persons selfreported level of altruism According to the researchers the results suggest that altruistic behavior may originate from how people view the world rather than how they act in it We believe that the ability to perceive other peoples actions as meaningful is critical for altruism said lead study investigator Dharol Tankersley Activation Of Brain Region Predicts Altruism PsychologyThe International Encyclopedia of the Social

examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory He identified four major motives for altruism altruism to ultimately benefit the self egoism to ultimately benefit the other person altruism to benefit a group collectivism or to uphold a moral principle principlism Altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism but the general

Dunning Eds  Social motivation pp 103126 New York NY US Psychology Press The empathyaltruism hypothesis basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering Feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions People with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to

April 4 2007In psychological research on altruism studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping comforting sharing cooperation philanthropy and community service Research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the persons distress Research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping the Bystander effect Greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility Hudson

volunteered over a 30year period and found that 52 of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36 of those who did volunteer experienced one A study on adults ages 55 found that during the fouryear study period people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63 lower likelihood of dying After controlling for prior health status it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a 44 reduction in mortality Merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater wellbeing A study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness It is important to note that while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness it has also been found to work in the opposite directionthat happier people are also kinder The relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional Studies have found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states Studies have also been careful to note that feeling overtaxed by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness For example one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one although positive effects were still significant Additionally while generous acts make people feel good about themselves it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others Studies suggest that gratitude goes handinhand with kindness and is also very important for our wellbeing A study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals positive affect offering emotional support sleep quality and wellbeing SociologySociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society Altruism Morality and Social Solidarity American Sociological Association American Sociological Association Altruism Morality and Social Solidarity  The structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable philanthropic and other prosocial altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field The American Sociology Association ASA acknowledges Public sociology saying The intrinsic scientific policy and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct good societies is unquestionable Altruism Morality and Social Solidarity ASA This type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies How altruism is framed organized carried out and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and build the good society Religious viewpointsMost if not all of the worlds religions promote altruism as a very important moral value Buddhism Christianity Hinduism Islam Jainism Judaism and Sikhism etc place particular emphasis on altruistic moralityBuddhismMonks collecting almsAltruism figures prominently in Buddhism Love and compassion are components of all forms of Buddhism and are focused on all beings equally love is the wish that all beings be happy and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering Many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion These qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness and the need for them lies at the very core of our being Dalai Lama Speech by the Dalai Lama Since all beings includes the individual love and compassion in Buddhism are outside the opposition between self and other It is even said that the distinction between self and other is part of the root cause of our suffering In practical terms however since most of us are spontaneously selfcentered Buddhism encourages us to focus love and compassion on others and thus can be characterized as altruistic Many would agree with the Dalai Lama that Buddhism as a religion is kindness toward othersStill the notion of altruism is modified in such a worldview since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness The more we care for the happi
aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvQXluX1JhbmQ=,Ayn Rand   born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum  March 6 1982 was a RussianAmerican novelist philosopher     playwright and screenwriter She is known for her two bestselling novels The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged and for developing a philosophical system she called Objectivism Born and educated in Russia Rand moved to the United States in 1926 She worked as a screenwriter in Hollywood and had a play produced on Broadway in 19351936 After two early novels that were initially less successful she achieved fame with her 1943 novel The Fountainhead In 1957 she published her bestknown work the novel Atlas Shrugged Afterward she turned to nonfiction to promote her philosophy publishing her own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982 Rand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge and rejected faith and religion She supported rational and ethical egoism and rejected ethical altruism In politics she condemned the initiation of force as immoral     and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism instead supporting a minarchist limited government and laissezfaire capitalism which she believed was the only social system that protected individual rights In art Rand promoted romantic realism She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her except for some Aristotelians and classical liberals  Rands fiction was poorly received by many literary critics and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas both to the public and in academic settings She has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives  LifeEarly lifeRand was born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum  on February 2 1905 to a bourgeois family living in Saint Petersburg She was the eldest of the three daughters of Zinovy Zakharovich Rosenbaum and his wife Anna Borisovna ne Kaplan largely nonobservant Jews Zinovy Rosenbaum was a successful pharmacist eventually owning a pharmacy and the building in which it was located   Rand found school unchallenging and said she began writing screenplays at the age of eight and novels at the age of ten She was twelve at the time of the February Revolution of 1917 during which she favored Alexander Kerensky over Tsar Nicholas II The subsequent October Revolution and the rule of the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin disrupted the comfortable life the family had previously enjoyed Her fathers pharmacy business was confiscated and the family displaced They fled to the Crimea which was initially under control of the White Army during the Russian Civil War She later recalled that while in high school she determined that she was an atheist and that she valued reason above any other human virtue After graduating from high school in the Crimea at 16 Rand returned with her family to Petrograd the new name for Saint Petersburg where they faced desperate conditions on occasion nearly starving Rand completed a threeyear program at Petrograd State UniversityAfter the Russian Revolution universities were opened to women allowing Rand to be in the first group of women to enroll at Petrograd State University where she studied in the department of social pedagogy majoring in history At the university she was introduced to the writings of Aristotle and Plato who would be her greatest influence and counterinfluence respectively  A third figure whose philosophical works she studied heavily was Friedrich Nietzsche Able to read French German and Russian Rand also discovered the writers Fyodor Dostoevsky Victor Hugo Edmond Rostand and Friedrich Schiller who became her perennial favorites Along with many other bourgeois students Rand was purged from the university shortly before graduating However after complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate  which Rand did in October 1924 She subsequently studied for a year at the State Technicum for Screen Arts in Leningrad For one of her assignments she wrote an essay about the Polish actress Pola Negri which became her first published work By this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be Rand possibly as a Cyrillic contraction of her birth surname  and she adopted the first name Ayn either from a Finnish name or from the Hebrew word ayin meaning eye Rand said the origin of Ayn was Finnish  but some biographical sources question this suggesting it may come from a Hebrew nickname provides a detailed discussion Cover of Rands first published work a 2500word monograph on femme fatale Pola Negri published in 1925  Arrival in America In the fall of 1925 Rand was granted a visa to visit American relatives Rand was so impressed with the skyline of Manhattan upon her arrival in New York Harbor that she cried what she later called tears of splendor Intent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter she lived for a few months with relatives in Chicago one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed her to watch dozens of films for free She then set out for Hollywood California Initially Rand struggled in Hollywood and took odd jobs to pay her basic living expenses A chance meeting with famed director Cecil B DeMille led to a job as an extra in his film The King of Kings and to subsequent work as a junior screenwriter While working on The King of Kings she met an aspiring young actor Frank OConnor the two were married on April 15 1929 Rand became an American citizen in 1931 Taking various jobs during the 1930s to support her writing Rand worked for a time as the head of the costume department at RKO Studios  She made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the United States but they were unable to acquire permission to emigrate  Early fictionRands first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay Red Pawn to Universal Studios in 1932 although it was never produced This was followed by the courtroom drama Night of January 16th first produced by EE Clive in Hollywood in 1934 and then successfully reopened on Broadway in 1935 Each night the jury was selected from members of the audience and one of the two different endings depending on the jurys verdict would then be performed In 1941 Paramount Pictures produced a movie version of the play Rand did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result  Rands first novel the semiautobiographical We the Living was published in 1936 Set in Soviet Russia it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state In a 1959 foreword to the novel Rand stated that We the Living is as near to an autobiography as I will ever write It is not an autobiography in the literal but only in the intellectual sense The plot is invented the background is not Initial sales were slow and the American publisher let it go out of print although European editions continued to sell Ralston Richard E Publishing We the Living In After the success of her later novels Rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies Ralston Richard E Publishing We the Living In Without Rands knowledge or permission the novel was made into a pair of Italian films Noi vivi and Addio Kira in 1942 Rediscovered in the 1960s these films were reedited into a new version which was approved by Rand and rereleased as We the Living in 1986 Her novella Anthem was written during a break from the writing of her next major novel The Fountainhead It presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word I has been forgotten and replaced with we  It was published in England in 1938 but Rand initially could not find an American publisher As with We the Living Rands later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946 which has sold more than 35 million copies Ralston Richard E Publishing Anthem In The Fountainhead and political activismDuring the 1940s Rand became politically active Both she and her husband worked fulltime in volunteer positions for the 1940 presidential campaign of Republican Wendell Willkie This work led to Rands first public speaking experiences including fielding the sometimes hostile questions from New York City audiences who had just viewed proWillkie newsreels an experience she greatly enjoyed This activity also brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to freemarket capitalism She became friends with journalist Henry Hazlitt and his wife and Hazlitt introduced her to the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises Despite her philosophical differences with them Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career and both of them expressed admiration for her Once Mises referred to Rand as the most courageous man in America a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said man instead of woman   Rand also developed a friendship with libertarian writer Isabel Paterson Rand questioned the wellinformed Paterson about American history and politics long into the night during their numerous meetings and gave Paterson ideas for her only nonfiction book The God of the Machine Rands first major success as a writer came with The Fountainhead in 1943 a romantic and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years The novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named Howard Roark and his struggle against what Rand described as secondhandersthose who attempt to live through others placing others above self It was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the BobbsMerrill Company on the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it While completing the novel Rand was prescribed the amphetamine Benzedrine to fight fatigue The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the finished novel but when the book was done she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks rest Her continued use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings  The Fountainhead eventually became a worldwide success bringing Rand fame and financial security  In 1943 Rand sold the rights for a film version to Warner Bros and she returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay Finishing her work on that screenplay she was hired by producer Hal Wallis as a screenwriter and scriptdoctor Her work for Wallis included the screenplays for the Oscarnominated Love Letters and You Came Along  This role gave Rand time to work on other projects including a planned nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called The Moral Basis of Individualism Although the planned book was never completed a condensed version was published as an essay titled The Only Path to Tomorrow in the January 1944 edition of Readers Digest magazine  While working in Hollywood Rand extended her involvement with freemarket and anticommunist activism She became involved with the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals a Hollywood antiCommunist group and wrote articles on the groups behalf She also joined the antiCommunist American Writers Association A visit by Isabel Paterson to meet with Rands California associates led to a final falling out between the two when Paterson made comments that Rand saw as rude to valued political allies  In 1947 during the Second Red Scare Rand testified as a friendly witness before the United States House UnAmerican Activities Committee Her testimony described the disparity between her personal experiences in the Soviet Union and the portrayal of it in the 1944 film Song of Russia Rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union portraying life there as being much better and happier than it actually was She wanted to also criticize the lauded 1946 film The Best Years of Our Lives for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world but she was not allowed to testify about it When asked after the hearings about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations Rand described the process as futile After several delays the film version of The Fountainhead was released in 1949 Although it used Rands screenplay with minimal alterations she disliked the movie from beginning to end complaining about its editing acting and other elements Atlas Shrugged and ObjectivismIn the years following the publication of The Fountainhead Rand received numerous letters from readers some of whom it profoundly influenced In 1951 Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City where she gathered a group of these admirers around her This group jokingly designated The Collective included future Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal later Nathaniel Branden and his wife Barbara and Barbaras cousin Leonard Peikoff At first the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy Later she began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel Atlas Shrugged as the manuscript pages were written In 1954 Rands close relationship with the younger Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair with the consent of their spouses Atlas Shrugged published in 1957 was Rands magnum opus  Rand described the theme of the novel as the role of the mind in mans existenceand as a corollary the demonstration of a new moral philosophy the morality of rational selfinterest Salmieri Gregory Atlas Shrugged on the Role of the Mind in Mans Existence In It advocates the core tenets of Rands philosophy of Objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement The plot involves a dystopian United States in which the most creative industrialists scientists and artists go on strike and retreat to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent free economy The novels hero and leader of the strike John Galt describes the strike as stopping the motor of the world by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nations wealth and achievement With this fictional strike Rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive the economy would collapse and society would fall apart The novel includes elements of romance mystery and science fiction and it contains Rands most extensive statement of Objectivism in any of her works of fiction a lengthy monologue delivered by GaltDespite many negative reviews Atlas Shrugged became an international bestseller and in an interview with Mike Wallace Rand declared herself the most creative thinker alive After completing the novel Rand fell into a severe depression  Atlas Shrugged was Rands last completed work of fiction a turning point in her life it marked the end of Rands career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher In 1958 Nathaniel Branden established Nathaniel Branden Lectures later incorporated as the Nathaniel Branden Institute NBI to promote Rands philosophy Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for Objectivist periodicals that she edited Rand later published some of these articles in book form Critics including some former NBI students and Branden himself have described the culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand with some describing NBI or the Objectivist movement itself as a cult or religion  Rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair and some of her followers mimicked her preferences wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers Rand was unimpressed with many of the NBI students and held them to strict standards sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her   However some former NBI students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated with the problem being concentrated among Rands closest followers in New York  Later yearsThroughout the 1960s and 1970s Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as Yale Princeton Columbia Harvard and MIT She received an honorary doctorate from Lewis  Clark College in 1963 She also began delivering annual lectures at the Ford Hall Forum responding afterward to questions from the audience During these speeches and QA sessions she often took controversial stances on political and social issues of the day These included supporting abortion rights opposing the Vietnam War and the military draft but condemning many draft dodgers as bums  supporting Israel in the ArabIsraeli War of 1973 against Palestinians and Arabs as civilized men fighting savages  saying European colonists had the right to take land from American Indians  and calling homosexuality immoral and disgusting while also advocating the repeal of all laws against it She also endorsed several Republican candidates for President of the United States most strongly Barry Goldwater in 1964 whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for The Objectivist Newsletter  altA twin gravestone bearing the name Frank OConnor on the left and Ayn Rand OConnor on the rightIn 1964 Nathaniel Branden began an affair with the young actress Patrecia Scott whom he later married Nathaniel and Barbara Branden kept the affair hidden from Rand When she learned of it in 1968 though her romantic relationship with Branden had already ended Rand terminated her relationship with both Brandens which led to the closure of NBI Rand published an article in The Objectivist repudiating Nathaniel Branden for dishonesty and other irrational behavior in his private life Branden later apologized in an interview to every student of Objectivism for perpetuating the Ayn Rand mystique and for contributing to that dreadful atmosphere of intellectual repressiveness that pervades the Objectivist movement In subsequent years Rand and several more of her closest associates parted company Rand underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking In 1976 she retired from writing her newsletter and despite her initial objections was persuaded to allow Evva Pryor a consultant from her attorneys office to sign her up for Social Security and Medicare During the late 1970s her activities within the Objectivist movement declined especially after the death of her husband on November 9 1979 One of her final projects was work on a nevercompleted television adaptation of Atlas Shrugged Rand died of heart failure on March 6 1982 at her home in New York City and was interred in the Kensico Cemetery Valhalla New York Rands funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers including Alan Greenspan A sixfoot floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket In her will Rand named Leonard Peikoff the heir to her estate PhilosophyRand called her philosophy Objectivism describing its essence as the concept of man as a heroic being with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life with productive achievement as his noblest activity and reason as his only absolute She considered Objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics epistemology ethics political philosophy and esthetics   In metaphysics Rand supported philosophical realism and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism including all forms of religion Den Uyl Douglas J  Rasmussen Douglas B Ayn Rands Realism In In epistemology she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception the validity of which she considered axiomatic  and reason which she described as the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by mans senses She rejected all claims of nonperceptual or a priori knowledge including instinct intuition revelation or any form of just knowing In her Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology Rand presented a theory of concept formation and endorsed the rejection of the analyticsynthetic dichotomy  In ethics Rand argued for rational egoism rational selfinterest as the guiding moral principle She said the individual should exist for his own sake neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself She referred to egoism as the virtue of selfishness in her book of that title in which she presented her solution to the isought problem by describing a metaethical theory that based morality in the needs of mans survival qua man   She condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness and held that the initiation of force was evil and irrational writing in Atlas Shrugged that Force and mind are opposites  Rands political philosophy emphasized individual rights including property rights and she considered laissezfaire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights  She opposed statism which she understood to include theocracy absolute monarchy Nazism fascism communism democratic socialism and dictatorship Rand believed that rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government Although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian she preferred the term radical for capitalism She worked with conservatives on political projects but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics    She denounced libertarianism which she associated with anarchism  She rejected anarchism as a nave theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice   Rands esthetics defined art as a selective recreation of reality according to an artists metaphysical valuejudgments According to Rand art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness As a writer the art form Rand focused on most closely was literature where she considered Romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will She described her own approach to literature as romantic realism  Rand acknowledged Aristotle as her greatest influence and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend three AsAristotle Aquinas and Ayn Rand Indeed her debt to Aristotle was so great that in a 1959 interview with Mike Wallace when asked where her philosophy came from she responded Out of my own mind with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to Aristotle who is the only philosopher who ever influenced me I devised the rest of my philosophy myself httpwwwyoutubecomwatchfeatureendscreenNR1vzEruXzQZhNI However she also found early inspiration in Friedrich Nietzsche   and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from Rands journals   in passages from the first edition of We the Living which Rand later revised   LoiretPrunet Valerie Ayn Rand and Feminist Synthesis Rereading We the Living In and in her overall writing style  Sheaffer Robert Rereading Rand on Gender in the Light of Paglia In  However by the time she wrote The Fountainhead Rand had turned against Nietzsches ideas   and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed   Mayhew Robert We the Living 36 and 59 In  Among the philosophers Rand held in particular disdain was Immanuel Kant whom she referred to as a monster although philosophers George Walsh and Fred Seddon have argued that she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differencesRand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her theory of concepts ethics and discovery in politics that evilthe violation of rightsconsists of the initiation of force She believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy stating I am not primarily an advocate of capitalism but of egoism and I am not primarily an advocate of egoism but of reason If one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently all the rest follows Reception and legacyReviewsDuring Rands lifetime her work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation Rands first novel We the Living was admired by the literary critic HL Mencken her Broadway play Night of January 16th was both a critical and popular success and The Fountainhead was hailed by a reviewer in The New York Times as masterful Reprinted in Rands novels were derided by some critics when they were first published as being long and melodramatic However they became bestsellers largely through word of mouth  The first reviews Rand received were for Night of January 16th Reviews of the production were largely positive but Rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer Rand believed that her first novel We the Living was not widely reviewed but Rand scholar Michael S Berliner says it was the most reviewed of any of her works with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications Overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work Berliner Michael S Reviews of We the Living In Her 1938 novella Anthem received little attention from reviewers both for its first publication in England and for subsequent reissues Berliner Michael S Reviews of Anthem In Rands first bestseller The Fountainhead received far fewer reviews than We the Living and reviewers opinions were mixed Berliner Michael S The Fountainhead Reviews In There was a positive review in The New York Times that Rand greatly appreciated The reviewer called Rand a writer of great power who wrote brilliantly beautifully and bitterly and stated that you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time There were other positive reviews but Rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications Some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel such as one that called it a whale of a book and another that said anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paperrationing Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and Rands style offensively pedestrian Rands 1957 novel Atlas Shrugged was widely reviewed and many of the reviews were strongly negative Berliner Michael S The Atlas Shrugged Reviews In In the National Review conservative author Whittaker Chambers called the book sophomoric and remarkably silly He described the tone of the book as shrillness without reprieve and accused Rand of supporting a Godless system which he related to that of the Soviets claiming From almost any page of Atlas Shrugged a voice can be heard from painful necessity commanding To a gas chambergo Atlas Shrugged received positive reviews from a few publications including praise from the noted book reviewer John Chamberlain but Rand scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein later wrote that reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest putdowns calling it execrable claptrap and a nightmare they said it was written out of hate and showed remorseless hectoring and prolixity Author Flannery OConnor wrote in a letter to a friend that The fiction of Ayn Rand is as low as you can get re fiction I hope you picked it up off the floor of the subway and threw it in the nearest garbage pail Rands nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels had The tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book For the New Intellectual was similar to that for Atlas Shrugged with philosopher Sidney Hook likening her certainty to the way philosophy is written in the Soviet Union and author Gore Vidal calling her viewpoint nearly perfect in its immorality Reprinted from Esquire July 1961 Her subsequent books got progressively less attention from reviewers On the 100th anniversary of Rands birth in 2005 Edward Rothstein writing for The New York Times referred to her fictional writing as quaint utopian retro fantasy and programmatic neoRomanticism of the misunderstood artist while criticizing her characters isolated rejection of democratic society In 2007 book critic Leslie Clark described her fiction as romance novels with a patina of pseudophilosophy In 2009 GQs critic columnist Tom Carson described her books as capitalisms

Africa and in the Mediterranean The country is bordered in the northeast by Tunisia in the east by Libya in the west by Morocco in the southwest by Western Sahara Mauritania and Mali in the southeast by Niger and in the north by the Mediterranean Sea Algeria is a member of the African Union the Arab League OPEC and the United Nations and is a founding member of the Arab Maghreb UnionThe territory of todays Algeria was the home of many ancient prehistoric cultures including Aterian and Capsian cultures Its area has known many empires and dynasties including ancient Berber Numidians Carthaginians Romans Vandals Byzantines Arab Umayyads Berber Fatimids Berber Almohads and later Turkish OttomansEtymologyThe countrys name derives from the city of Algiers The most common etymology links the city name to alJazir  The Islands a truncated form of the citys older name Jazir Ban Mazghanna    Islands of the Mazghanna Tribe employed by medieval geographers such as alIdrisi Others trace it to Ldzayer the Maghrebi Arabic and Berber for Algeria possibly related to the Zirid Dynasty King Ziri ibnManad and founder of the city of Algiers HistoryAncient historyDetail of Tassili rock paintings dating from about 3000 BC relating a probably lost civilization in what was known as the Green SaharaAt Ain Hanech region Sada Province early remnants 200000 BC of hominid occupation in North Africa were found Neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the Levalloisian and Mousterian styles 43000 BC similar to those in the Levant Algeria was the site of the highest state of development of Middle Paleolithic Flake tool techniques Tools of this era starting about 30000 BC are called Aterian after the archeological site of Bir el Ater south of AnnabaThe earliest blade industries in North Africa are called Iberomaurusian located mainly in Oran region This industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the Maghreb between 15000 and 10000 BC Neolithic civilization animal domestication and agriculture developed in the Saharan and Mediterranean Maghrib between 6000 and 2000 BC This life richly depicted in the Tassili nAjjer paintings predominated in Algeria until the classical periodThe amalgam of peoples of North Africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called Berbers who are the indigenous peoples of northern Africa Ancient Roman theatre in DjmilaFrom their principal center of power at Carthage the Carthaginians expanded and established small settlements along the North African coast by 600 BC a Phoenician presence existed at Tipasa east of Cherchell Hippo Regius modern Annaba and Rusicade modern Skikda These settlements served as market towns as well as anchoragesAs Carthaginian power grew its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically Berber civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture manufacturing trade and political organization supported several states Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from othersNumidia along with Egypt Rome and Carthage 200 BCEBy the early 4th century BC Berbers formed the single largest element of the Carthaginian army In the Revolt of the Mercenaries Berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 BC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the First Punic War They succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthages North African territory and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the Punic WarsIn 146 BC the city of Carthage was destroyed As Carthaginian power waned the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew By the 2nd century BC several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged Two of them were established in Numidia behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage West of Numidia lay Mauretania which extended across the Moulouya River in modern day Morocco to the Atlantic Ocean The high point of Berber civilization unequaled until the coming of the Almohads and Almoravids more than a millennium later was reached during the reign of Massinissa in the 2nd century BCAfter Masinissas death in 148 BC the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times Massinissas line survived until 24 AD when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the Roman EmpireFor several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans who founded many colonies in the region Like the rest of North Africa Algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire exporting cereals and other agricultural products The Vandals of Geiseric moved into North Africa in 429 and by 435 controlled coastal Numidia They did not make any significant settlement on the land The region was later recaptured by the Eastern Roman Empire which ruled it until the Muslim Conquest in the 7th centuryMiddle AgesMansourah mosque TlemcenFatimid Caliphate 969 ADWhen Muslim Arabs arrived in Algeria in the mid7th century a large number of locals converted to the new faith After the fall of the Umayyad Arab Dynasty in 751 numerous local Berber dynasties emerged Amongst those dynasties were the Aghlabids Almohads Abdalwadid Zirids Rustamids Hammadids Almoravids and the Fatimids converted the Berber Kutama of the Petite Kabylie to its cause the Shia Fatimids overthrew the Rustamids and conquered Egypt leaving Algeria and Tunisia to their Zirid vassals When the latter rebelled the Shia Fatimids sent in the Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym Arabian tribes who unexpectedly defeated the ZiridsThe Berber people controlled much of the Maghreb region throughout the Middle Ages The Berbers were made up of several tribes The two main branches were the Botr and Barns tribes who were divided into tribes and again into subtribes Each region of the Maghreb contained several tribes for example Sanhadja Houaras Zenata Masmouda Kutama Awarba and Berghwata All these tribes were independent and made territorial decisions Several Berber dynasties emerged during the Middle Ages in Maghreb Sudan Andalusia Sicily Mali Niger Senegal Egypt and other nearby lands Ibn Khaldun provides a table summarizing the Zirid Banu Ifran Maghrawa Almoravid Hammadid Almohad Merinid Abdalwadid Wattasid Meknassa and Hafsid dynasties In the early 16th century Spain constructed fortified outposts presidios on or near the Algerian coast Spain took control of Mers el Kebir in 1505 Oran in 1509 and Tlemcen Mostaganem and Tns in 1510 In the same year the merchants of Algiers ceded one of the rocky islets in their harbor to Spain which built a fort on it The presidios in North Africa turned out to be a costly and largely ineffective military endeavor that did not guarantee access for Spains merchant fleet Ottoman AlgeriaBarbarossa Hayreddin PashaIn 1516 the Muslim privateer brothers Aruj and Hayreddin Barbarossa who operated successfully under the Hafsids moved their base of operations to Algiers When Aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of Tlemcen Hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of Algiers The Ottoman sultan gave him the title of beylerbey and a contingent of some 2000 janissaries With the aid of this force Hayreddin subdued the coastal region between Constantine and Oran although the city of Oran remained in Spanish hands until 1791 The next beylerbey was Hayreddins son Hasan who assumed the position in 1544 Until 1587 the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits Subsequently with the institution of a regular Ottoman administration governors with the title of pasha ruled for threeyear terms The pasha was assisted by janissaries known in Algeria as the ojaq and led by an agha Discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid1600s because they were not paid regularly and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha As a result the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659 Plague had repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa Algiers lost from 30000 to 50000 inhabitants to the plague in 162021 and suffered high fatalities in 165457 1665 1691 and 174042 In 1671 the taifa rebelled killed the agha and placed one of its own in power The new leader received the title of dey After 1689 the right to select the dey passed to the divan a council of some sixty notables It was at first dominated by theojaq but by the 18th century it had become the deys instrument In 1710 the dey persuaded the sultan to recognize him and his successors as regent replacing the pasha in that role Although Algiers remained a part of the Ottoman Empire the Ottoman government ceased to have effective influence there The dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat The dey was elected for a life term but in the 159 years 16711830 that the system survived fourteen of the twentynine deys were assassinated Despite usurpation military coups and occasional mob rule the daytoday operation of government was remarkably orderly Although the regency patronized the tribal chieftains it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest Autonomous tribal states were tolerated and the regencys authority was seldom applied in the Kabylie Privateers eraChristian slaves in Algiers 1706 The Barbary pirates preyed on Christian and other nonIslamic shipping in the western Mediterranean Sea The pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as slaves They also did a brisk business in ransoming some of the captives According to Robert Davis from the 16th to 19th century pirates captured 1 million to 125 million Europeans as slaves They often made raids called Razzias on European coastal towns to capture Christian slaves to sell at slave markets in North Africa and the Ottoman Empire In 1544 Hayreddin captured the island of Ischia taking 4000 prisoners and enslaved some 9000 inhabitants of Lipari almost the entire population In 1551 Turgut Reis enslaved the entire population of the Maltese island of Gozo between 5000 and 6000 sending the captives to Libya In 1554 pirates sacked Vieste in southern Italy and took an estimated 7000 captives as slaves In 1558 Barbary corsairs captured the town of Ciutadella Minorca destroyed it slaughtered the inhabitants and took 3000 survivors as slaves to Istanbul Barbary pirates often attacked the Balearic Islands and in response the residents built many coastal watchtowers and fortified churchesd The threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of Formentera Between 1609 to 1616 England lost 466 merchant ships to Barbary pirates In the 19th century the pirates forged affiliations with Caribbean powers paying a license tax in exchange for safe harbor of their vessels One American slave reported that the Algerians had enslaved 130 American seamen in the Mediterranean and Atlantic from 1785 to 1793 Piracy on American vessels in the Mediterranean resulted in the United States initiating the First 18011805 and Second Barbary Wars 1815 Following those wars Algeria was weaker and Europeans with an AngloDutch fleet commanded by the British Lord Exmouth attacked Algiers After a ninehour bombardment they obtained a treaty from the Dey that reaffirmed the conditions imposed by Decatur US navy concerning the demands of tributes In addition the Dey agreed to end the practice of enslaving Christians French AlgeriaThe Fan Affair which was the pretext for the invasionOn the pretext of a slight to their consul the French invaded and captured Algiers in 1830 The conquest of Algeria by the French was long and resulted in considerable bloodshed A combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the indigenous Algerian population to decline by nearly onethird from 1830 to 1872 The population of Algeria which stood at about 15 million in 1830 reached nearly 11 million in 1960 French policy was predicated on civilizing the country although its literacy rate of 50 in 1830 according to some Algerian historians exceeded that of France Algerias social fabric suffered during the occupation literacy plummeted During this period a small but influential Frenchspeaking indigenous elite was formed made up of Berbers mostly from KabylesIn the French policy of divide to reign its government favored the Kabyles About 80 of Indigenous Schools were constructed for KabylesFrom 1848 until independence France administered the whole Mediterranean region of Algeria as an integral part and dpartement of the nation One of Frances longestheld overseas territories Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of European immigrants who became known as colons and later as piedsnoirs Between 1825 and 1847 50000 French people emigrated to Algeria These settlers benefited from the French governments confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land Gradually dissatisfaction among the Muslim population which lacked political and economic status in the colonial system gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from France Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954 when the first violent events of what was later called the Algerian War began Historians have estimated that between 30000 and 150000 Harkis and their dependents were killed by the Front de Libration Nationale FLN or by lynch mobs in Algeria The FLN used terrorist attacks in Algeria and France as part of its war and the French conducted severe reprisals and repression The war concluded in 1962 when Algeria gained complete independence following the March 1962 Evian agreements and the July 1962 selfdetermination referendumIndependenceHouari Boumedienne 1966Algerias first president was the FLN leader Ahmed Ben Bella Moroccos claim to portions of western Algeria led to the Sand War in 1963 Ben Bella was overthrown in 1965 by Houari Boumdienne his former ally and defense minister Under Ben Bella the government had become increasingly socialist and authoritarian Boumdienne continued this trend But he relied much more on the army for his support and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role He collectivised agriculture and launched a massive industrialization drive Oil extraction facilities were nationalized This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international 1973 oil crisisIn the 1960s and 1970s under President Houari Boumediene Algeria pursued a programme of industrialisation within a statecontrolled socialist economy Boumedienes successor Chadli Bendjedid introduced some liberal economic reforms He promoted a policy of Arabisation in Algerian society and public life Teachers of Arabic brought in from other Muslim countries spread radical Islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of political Islamism The Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the 1980s oil glut Economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in Algerian social unrest during the 1980s by the end of the decade Bendjedid introduced a multiparty system Political parties developed such as the Front Islamique du Salut FIS a broad coalition of Islamist groups Civil War and aftermathIn December 1991 the Front Islamique du Salut dominated the first of two rounds of legislative elections Fearing the election of an Islamist government the authorities intervened on 11 January 1992 cancelling the elections Bendjedid resigned and a High Council of State was installed to act as Presidency It banned the FIS triggering a civil insurgency between its armed wing the Armed Islamic Group and the national armed forces in which more than 100000 persons are thought to have died The Armed Islamic Group declared a ceasefire in October 1997 Algeria held elections in 1999 which were won by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika He worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a Civil Concord initiative approved in a referendum under which many political prisoners were pardoned and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty in force until 13 January 2000 The AIS disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly The Groupe Salafiste pour la Prdication et le Combat GSPC a splinter group of the Group Islamic Arme continued a terrorist campaign against the Government Bouteflika was reelected in the April 2004 presidential election after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation The programme comprised economic institutional political and social reform to modernise the country raise living standards and tackle the causes of alienation It also included a second amnesty initiative the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation which was approved in a referendum in September 2005 It offered amnesty to most guerrillas and Government security forces In November 2008 the Algerian Constitution was amended following a vote in Parliament removing the twoterm limit on Presidential incumbents This change enabled Bouteflika to stand for reelection in the 2009 presidential elections and he was reelected in April 2009 During his election campaign and following his reelection Bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a 150billion spending programme to create three million new jobs the construction of one million new housing units and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes A continuing series of protests throughout the country started on 28 December 2010 inspired by similar protests across the Middle East and North Africa On 24 February 2011 the government lifted Algerias 19yearold state of emergency The government enacted legislation dealing with political parties the electoral code and the representation of women in elected bodies In April 2011 Bouteflika promised further constitutional and political reform  Geography The Sahara the Ahaggar and the Atlas mountains compose the Algerian reliefAlgeria is the largest country in Africa the Arab world and the Mediterranean Basin Its southern part includes a significant portion of the Sahara To the north the Tell Atlas form with the Saharan Atlas further south two parallel sets of reliefs in approaching eastbound and between which are inserted vast plains and highlands Both Atlas tend to merge in eastern Algeria The vast mountain ranges of Aures and Nememcha occupy the entire northeastern Algeria and are delineated by the Tunisian border The highest point is Mount Tahat  mAlgeria lies mostly between latitudes 19 and 37N a small area is north of 37 and longitudes 9W and 12E Most of the coastal area is hilly sometimes even mountainous and there are a few natural harbours The area from the coast to the Tell Atlas is fertile South of the Tell Atlas is a steppe landscape ending with the Saharan Atlas farther south there is the Sahara desertThe Ahaggar Mountains  also known as the Hoggar are a highland region in central Sahara southern Algeria They are located about 1500 km south of the capital Algiers and just west of Tamanghasset Algiers Oran Constantine Tizi Ouzou and Annaba are Algerias main cities Climate and hydrology An oasis in the HoggarIn this region midday desert temperatures can be hot year round After sunset however the clear dry air permits rapid loss of heat and the nights are cool to chilly Enormous daily ranges in temperature are recordedThe highest official temperature was 506 C at In Salah Rainfall is fairly plentiful along the coastal part of the Tell Atlas ranging from 400 to annually the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east Precipitation is heaviest in the northern part of eastern Algeria where it reaches as much as 1000 mm in some yearsFarther inland the rainfall is less plentiful Prevailing winds that are easterly and northeasterly in summer change to westerly and northerly in winter and carry with them a general increase in precipitation from September through December a decrease in the late winter and spring months and a near absence of rainfall during the summer months Algeria also has ergs or sand dunes between mountains Among these in the summer time when winds are heavy and gusty temperatures can get up to 110 F Fauna and Flora Cedrus of Chlia in the AuresThe varied vegetation of Algeria includes coastal mountainous and grassy desertlike regions which all support a wide range of wildlife Many of the creatures comprising the Algerian wildlife live in close proximity to civilization The most commonly seen animals include the wild boars jackals and gazelles although it is not uncommon to spot fennecs foxes and jerboas Algeria also has a few panther leopard and cheetah populations but these are seldom seenA variety of bird species makes the country an attraction for bird watchers The forests are inhabited by boars and jackals Barbary macaques are the sole native monkey Snakes monitor lizards and numerous other reptiles can be found living among an array of rodents throughout the semi arid regions of Algeria Many animals are now extinct among which the Barbary lions and bearsIn the north some of the native flora includes Macchia scrub olive trees oaks cedars and other conifers The mountain regions contain large forests of evergreens Aleppo pine juniper and evergreen oak and some deciduous trees Fig eucalyptus agave and various palm trees grow in the warmer areas The grape vine is indigenous to the coast In the Sahara region some oases have palm trees Acacias with wild olives are the predominant flora in the remainder of the SaharaCamels are used extensively the desert also abounds with poisonous and nonpoisonous snakes scorpions and numerous insects Politics The Peoples National AssemblyAlgeria is an authoritarian regime according to the Democracy Index 2010 The Freedom of the Press 2009 report gives it rating Not Free Elected politicians are considered to have relatively little sway over Algeria Instead a group of unelected civilian and military dcideurs known as le pouvoir the power actually rule the country even deciding who should be president The most powerful man may be Mohamed Medine head of the military intelligence In recent years many of these generals have died or retired After the death of General Larbi Belkheir Bouteflika put loyalists in key posts notably at Sonatrach and secured constitutional amendments that make him reelectable indefinitely The head of state is the president of Algeria who is elected for a fiveyear term The president was formerly limited to two fiveyear terms but a constitutional amendment passed by the Parliament on 11 November 2008 removed this limitation Algeria has universal suffrage at 18 years of age The President is the head of the army the Council of Ministers the High Security Council He appoints the Prime Minister who is also the head of government

while the upper house the Council of the Nation has 144 members serving sixyear terms of which 96 members are chosen by local assemblies and 48 are appointed by the president According to the constitution no political association may be formed if it is based on differences in religion language race gender profession or region In addition political campaigns must be exempt from the aforementioned subjects Article 42 of the Algerian constitution  Parliamentary elections were last held in May 2012 and were judged to be largely free by international monitors though local groups alleged fraud and irregularities In the elections the FLN won 221 seats the militarybacked National Rally for Democracy won 70 and the Islamist Green Algeria Alliance won 47 Foreign relationsIn October 2009 Algeria cancelled a weapons deal with France over the possibility of inclusion of Israeli parts in them Tensions between Algeria and Morocco in relation to the Western Sahara have been an

projects The total military expenditure in 2006 was estimated variously at 27 of GDP 3096 million or 33 of GDP In 2007 the Algerian Air Force signed a deal with Russia to purchase 49 MiG29SMT and 6 MiG29UBT at an estimated cost of 19 billion It also agreed to return old aircraft purchased from the former USSR Russia is also building two 636type diesel submarines for Algeria  Provinces and districts Algeria is divided into 48 provinces wilayas 553 districts daras and 1541 municipalities baladiyahs Each province district and municipality is named after its seat which is usually the largest cityThe administrative divisions have changed several times since independence When introducing new provinces the numbers of old provinces are kept hence the nonalphabetical order With their official numbers currently since 1983 they are EconomyGraphical depiction of the countrys exports in 28 colourcoded categoriesAlgeria is classified as an upper middle income country by the World Bank The economy remains dominated by the state a legacy of the countrys socialist postindependence development model In recent years the Algerian Government has halted the privatization of stateowned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy Algeria has struggled to develop industries outside of hydrocarbons in part because of high costs and an inert state bureaucracy The governments efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages The country is facing a number of shortterm and mediumterm problems including the need to diversify the economy strengthen political economic and financial reforms improve the business climate and reduce inequalities amongst regions A wave of economic protests in February and March 2011 prompted the Algerian Government to offer more than 23 billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases Public spending has increased by 27 annually during the past five years The 201014 publicinvestment programme will cost US 286 billion 40 of which will go to human development The Algerian economy grew by 26 in 2011 driven by public spending in particular in the construction and publicworks sector and by growing internal demand If hydrocarbons are excluded growth has been estimated at 48 Growth of 31 is expected in 2012 rising to 42 in 2013 The rate of inflation was 39 and the budget deficit 3 of GDP The currentaccount surplus is estimated at 93 of GDP and at the end of December 2011 official reserves were put at US 1822 billion Inflation the lowest in the region has remained stable at 4 on average between 2003 and 2007 In 2011 Algeria announced a budgetary surplus of 2693 billion 6246 increase in comparison to 2010 surplus In general the country exported 7339 billion worth of commodities while it imported 4645 billion Thanks to strong hydrocarbon revenues Algeria has a cushion of 173 billion in foreign currency reserves and a large hydrocarbon stabilization fund In addition Algerias external debt is extremely low at about 2 of GDP

and logia  discourse or study Since the work of Franz Boas and Bronisaw Malinowski in the late 19th and early 20th centuries anthropology has been distinguished from other social sciences by its emphasis on indepth examination of context crosscultural comparisons and the importance it places on participantobservation or longterm experiential immersion in the area of research Cultural

anthropology is known as ethnology a term coined and defined by Adam F Kollr in 1783 Han F Vermeulen The German Invention of Vlkerkunde Ethnological Discourse in Europe and Asia 17401798 In Sara Eigen and Mark Larrimore eds The German Invention of Race 2006 Anthropologists study topics including the origin and evolution of Homo sapiens the organization of human social and cultural relations human physical traits human behavior the variations among different groups of humans how the evolutionary past of Homo sapiens has influenced its social organization and culture and so forth What is Anthropology  American Anthropological Association What is Anthropology  Anthropology Report Anthropology originated in the colonial encounter between Western people and colonized nonWestern people as Europeans tried to understand the origins of observable cultural diversity Today anthropology is a global discipline and anthropologists study all types of societies Anthropology is one of the few places where humanities social and natural sciences are forced to confront one another As such anthropology has been central in the development of several new late 20th century interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science global studies and various ethnic studiesAccording to Clifford Geertz anthropology is perhaps the last of the great nineteenthcentury conglomerate disciplines still for the most part organizationally intact Long after natural history moral philosophy philology and political economy have dissolved into their specialized successors it has remained a diffuse assemblage of ethnology human biology comparative linguistics and prehistory held together mainly by the vested interests sunk costs and administrative habits of academia and by a romantic image of comprehensive scholarship Sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by structuralist and postmodern theories as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies During the 1970s and 1990s there was an epistemological shift away from the positivist traditions that had largely informed the discipline Geertz Behar Clifford  James During this shift enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology In contrast archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist Due to this difference in epistemology the four subfields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decadesSociocultural anthropologyCultural anthropology is also called sociocultural anthropology or social anthropology especially in the United Kingdom Cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the world around them while social anthropology is the study of the relationships among persons and groups Cultural anthropology is more akin to philosophy literature and the arts while social anthropology to sociology and history Anthropological inquiry is guided by cultural relativism the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values Accepting other cultures in their own terms prevents reductionism in crosscultural comparison This project has become the field of ethnography Ethnography can refer to both a methodology and a product of research namely a monograph or book As methodology ethnography is based upon longterm fieldwork within a community or other research site Participant observation is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology Bernard H Russell Research Methods in Anthropology Altamira Press 2002 p322 Ethnology involves the systematic comparison of different cultures The process of participantobservation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an emic or insiders point of view The study of kinship and social organization is a central focus of cultural anthropology as kinship is a human universal Cultural anthropology also covers economic and political organization law and conflict resolution patterns of consumption and exchange material culture technology infrastructure gender relations ethnicity childrearing and socialization religion myth symbols values etiquette worldview sports music nutrition recreation games food festivals and language which is also the object of study in

material lives of past societies Archaeologists examine these material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices Ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups who are presumed to have lived in similar ways Robbins R H  Larkin S N 2007 Cultural Anthropology A problem based approach Toronto ON Nelson Education Ltd Linguistic anthropologyLinguistic anthropology also called anthropological linguistics seeks to understand the processes of human communications verbal and nonverbal variation in language across time and space the social uses of language and the relationship between language and culture It is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes Linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including sociolinguistics pragmatics cognitive linguistics semiotics discourse analysis and narrative analysis Salzmann Zdenk 1993 Language culture and society an introduction to linguistic anthropology Boulder CO Westview Press  Key topics by field Sociocultural anthropologyAnthropology of art media music dance  film Anthropology of art A Punu tribe mask Gabon West AfricaOne of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of art as a cultural phenomenon Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of painting sculpture or literature conceived as independent artistic activities do not exist or exist in a significantly different form in most nonWestern contexts Robert Layton 1981 The Anthropology of Art To surmount this difficulty anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which without exclusively being artistic have certain evident aesthetic qualities Boas Primitive Art Claude LviStrauss The Way of the Masks 1982 or Geertzs Art as Cultural System 1983 are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of art into an anthropology of culturallyspecific aesthetics Media anthropology Anthropology of media also anthropology of mass media media anthropology emphasizes ethnographic studies as a means of understanding producers audiences and other cultural and social aspects of mass media The types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production eg ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers journalists in the field film production to contexts of media reception following audiences in their everyday responses to media Other types include cyber anthropology a relatively new area of internet research as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media such as development work social movements or health education This is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts where media such as radio the press new media and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s Deborah Spitulnik 1993 Anthropology and Mass Media

encompassing various approaches to the study of music broadly defined that emphasize its cultural social material cognitive biological and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire Visual anthropology Visual anthropology is concerned in part with the study and production of ethnographic photography film and since the mid1990s new media While the term is sometimes used interchangeably with ethnographic film visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation including areas such as performance museums art and the production and reception of mass media Visual representations from all cultures such as sandpaintings tattoos sculptures and reliefs cave paintings scrimshaw jewelry hieroglyphics paintings and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology Economic Political Economic Applied  Development anthropology  Economic anthropology Economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic geographic and cultural scope It has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics of which it is highly critical Its origins as a subfield of anthropology begin with the British founder of Anthropology Bronislaw Malinowski and his French compatriot Marcel Mauss on the nature of giftgiving exchange or reciprocity as an alternative to market exchange Economic Anthropology remains for the most part focused upon exchange The school of thought derived from Marx and known as Political Economy focuses on production in contrast Economic Anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists and have now turned to examine corporations banks and the global financial system from an anthropological perspectivePolitical economyPolitical Economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of Historical Materialism to the traditional concerns of anthropology including but not limited to noncapitalist societies Political Economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture Three main areas of interest rapidly developed The first of these areas was concerned with the precapitalist societies that were subject to evolutionary tribal stereotypes Sahlins work on Huntergatherers as the original affluent society did much to disapate that image The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the worlds population at the time the peasantry many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam The third area was on colonialism imperialism and the creation of the capitalist worldsystem More recently these Political Economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial and postindustrial capitalism around the world Applied anthropology Applied Anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems It is a complex of related researchbased instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data initiation of direct action andor the formulation of policy More simply applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community It is closely related to Development anthropology distinct from the more critical Anthropology of developmentAnthropology of developmentThe anthropology of development tends to view development from a critical perspective The kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach involve asking why if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty is poverty increasing Why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes Why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer Why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis In short why does so much planned development failAnthropology of Kinship Feminism Gender  Sexuality Kinship  family Kinship can refer both to the study of the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures or it can refer to the patterns of social relationships themselves Over its history anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms such as descent descent groups lineages affines cognates and even fictive kinship Broadly kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent ones social relations during development and also relatives by marriage Feminist anthropology Feminist Anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology archeological biological cultural linguistic that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings anthropological hiring practices and the scholarly production of knowledge Anthropology engages often with feminists from nonWestern traditions whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white European and American feminists Historically such peripheral perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the western world Feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream feminist theoryAnthropology of gender  sexualityMedical Psychological Cognitive  Transpersonal Anthropology Medical anthropology Old Chinese medical chart on acupuncture meridiansMedical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies human health and disease health care systems and biocultural adaptation Currently research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole It focuses on the following six basic fields the development of systems of medical knowledge and medical care the patientphysician relationship the integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse environments the interaction of social environmental and biological factors which influence health and illness both in the individual and the community as a wholethe critical analysis of interaction between psychiatric services and migrant populations critical ethnopsychiatry Beneduce 2004 2007 the impact of biomedicine and biomedical technologies in nonWestern settingsOther subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering Farmer 1999 2003 Beneduce 2010 as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness On the other hand there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production such as cultural psychiatry and transcultural psychiatry or ethnopsychiatry Psychological anthropology Psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of cultural and mental processes This subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans development and enculturation within a particular cultural groupwith its own history language practices and conceptual categoriesshape processes of human cognition emotion perception motivation and mental health It also examines how the understanding of cognition emotion motivation and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes DAndrade R G 1995 The development of cognitive anthropology New York Cambridge University Press Schwartz T G M White et al Eds 1992 New Directions in Psychological Anthropology Cambridge UK Cambridge University Press  Cognitive anthropology Cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge cultural innovation and transmission over time and space using the methods and theories of the cognitive sciences especially experimental psychology and evolutionary biology often through close collaboration with historians ethnographers archaeologists linguists musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and interpretation of cultural forms Cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them  Transpersonal anthropology Transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between altered states of consciousness and culture As with transpersonal psychology the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness ASC and transpersonal experience However the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of crosscultural issuesfor instance the roles of myth ritual diet and texts in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences Young and Goulet 1994Political  Legal anthropology Political anthropology Political anthropology concerns the structure of political systems looked at from the basis of the structure of societies Political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies a new development started from the 1960s and is still unfolding anthropologists started increasingly to study more complex social settings in which the presence of states bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena The turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels First of all anthropologists continued to study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside the stateregulated sphere as in patronclient relations or tribal political organization Second of all anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions and of course on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions An anthropology of the state developed and it is a most thriving field today Geertz comparative work on Negara the Balinese state is an early famous exampleLegal anthropologyLegal anthropology also known as Anthropology of Law specializes in the crosscultural study of social ordering Earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management crime sanctions or formal regulation More recent applications include issues such as Human Rights Legal pluralism Islamaphobia and Political Uprisings Public anthropology Public Anthropology was created by Robert Borofsky a professor at Hawaii Pacific University to demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline  illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change Borofsky 2004 Anthropology of Science  technologyCyborg anthropologyCyborg anthropology originated as a subfocus group within

philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term Cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings Digital anthropology Digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digitalera technology and extends to various areas where anthropology and technology intersect It is sometimes grouped with sociocultural anthropology and sometimes considered part of material culture The field is new and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases These include technoanthropology digital ethnography cyberanthropology and virtual anthropology  Ecological anthropology Ecological anthropology is defined as the study of cultural adaptations to environments The subfield is also defined as the study of relationships between a population of humans and their biophysical environment The focus of its research concerns how cultural beliefs and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments and how people used elements of their culture to maintain their ecosystems Environmental anthropology Anthropology of food nutrition and agriculture Historical anthropology Anthropology of religion The anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures Modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between magical thinking and religion

anthropology Urban anthropology is concerned with issues of urbanization poverty and neoliberalism Ulf Hannerz quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were a notoriously agoraphobic lot antiurban by definition Various social processes in the Western World as well as in the Third World the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists brought the attention of specialists in other cultures closer to their homes Hannerz Ulf 1980 Exploring the City Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology p1 There are two principle approaches in urban anthropology by examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities These two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other By defining different types of cities one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities By directly looking at the different social issues one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city Griffiths Michael

most of the poorest people in the world These systems are of interest as they sometimes retain a level of integration with natural ecological systems greater than that of industrial agriculture which may be more sustainable than some modern agricultural systems Food production and demand on a global basis with special attention paid to the major producers such as China India Brazil the USA and the EU Fertilizer One of the most common yield reducers is because of fertilizer not being applied in slightly higher quantities during transition period the time it takes the soil to rebuild its aggregates and organic matter Yields will decrease temporarily because of nitrogen being immobilized in the crop residue which can take a few months to several years to decompose depending on the crops C to N ratio and the local environmentAgricultural science a local scienceWith the exception of theoretical agronomy research in agronomy more than in any other field is strongly related to local areas It can be considered a science of ecoregions because it is closely linked to soil properties and climate which are never exactly the same from one place to another Many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather soil characteristics and specific crops has to be studied locally Others feel a need to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible and the human dimension of interaction with natureHistory of agricultural scienceAgricultural science began with Taras genetic work but in modern terms might be better dated from the chemical fertilizer outputs of plant physiological understanding in eighteenth century Germany In the United States a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the Hatch Act of 1887 which used the term agricultural science The Hatch Act was driven by farmers interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer The Ammy of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots but the scientific foundation had been built Hillison J 1996 The Origins of Agriscience Or Where Did All That Scientific Agriculture Come From Journal of Agricultural Education After 1906 public expenditures on agricultural research in the US exceeded private expenditures for the next 44 years Huffman WE Evenson RE 2006 Science for Agriculture Blackwell Publishing Intensification of agriculture since the 1960s in developed and developing countries often referred to as the Green Revolution was closely tied to progress made in selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial fertilizers and phytosanitary productsAs the oldest and largest human intervention in nature the environmental impact of agriculture in general and more recently intensive agriculture industrial development and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields These include technological fields that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology such as integrated pest management waste treatment technologies landscape architecture genomics and agricultural philosophy fields that include references to food production as something essentially different from nonessential economic goods In fact the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural scienceNew technologies such as biotechnology and computer science for data processing and storage and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields including genetic engineering agrophysics improved statistical analysis and precision farming Balancing these as

aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvQVNDSUk=,A chart of ASCII from a 1972 printer manualThe American Standard Code for Information Interchange ASCII    is a characterencoding scheme originally based on the English alphabet ASCII codes represent text in computers communications equipment and other devices that use text Most modern characterencoding schemes are based on ASCII though they support many additional charactersASCII developed from telegraphic codes Its first commercial use was as a sevenbit teleprinter code promoted by Bell data services Work on the ASCII standard began on October 6 1960 with the first meeting of the American Standards Associations ASA X32 subcommittee The first edition of the standard was published during 1963   a major revision during 1967  and the most recent update during 1986 Compared to earlier telegraph codes the proposed Bell code and ASCII were both ordered for more convenient sorting ie alphabetization of lists and added features for devices other than teleprintersASCII includes definitions for 128 characters 33 are nonprinting control characters many now obsolete that affect how text and space are processed International Organization for Standardization December 1 1975 The set of control characters for ISO 646 Internet Assigned Numbers Authority Registry Alternate US version  Accessed 20080414 and 95 printable characters including the space which is considered an invisible graphic RFC 20 ASCII format for Network Interchange ANSI X341968 October 16 1969 The IANA prefers the name USASCII to avoid ambiguity ASCII wasthe most commonly used character encoding on the World Wide Web until December 2007 when it was surpassed by UTF8 HistoryThe American Standard Code for Information Interchange ASCII was developed under the auspices of a committee of the American Standards Association called the X3 committee by its X32 later X3L2 subcommittee and later by that subcommittees X324 working group The ASA became the United States of America Standards Institute or USASI and ultimately the American National Standards InstituteThe X32 subcommittee designed ASCII based on the earlier teleprinter encoding systems Like other character encodings ASCII specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and character symbols ie graphemes and control characters This allows digital devices to communicate with each other and to process store and communicate characteroriented information such as written language Before ASCII was developed the encodings in use included 26 alphabetic characters 10 numerical digits and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbolsTo include all these and control characters compatible with the Comit Consultatif International Tlphonique et Tlgraphique CCITT International Telegraph Alphabet No 2 ITA2 standard Fieldata and early EBCDIC more than 64 codes were required for ASCIIThe committee debated the possibility of a shift key function like the Baudot code which would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by six bits In a shifted code some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codesIt allows compact encoding but is less reliable for data transmission an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable The standards committee decided against shifting and so ASCII required at least a sevenbit codeThe committee considered an eightbit code since eight bits octets would allow two fourbit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with binary coded decimal However it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice The committee voted to use a sevenbit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission Since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position it also allowed for a parity bit for error checking if desired Eightbit machines with octets as the native data type that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0 Sawyer A Sawyer and Steven George Krantz January 1 1995 A Tex Primer for Scientists CRC Press ISBN 0849371597 p13 The code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together for ease of identification The first two columns 32 positions were reserved for control characters The space character had to come before graphics to make sorting easier so it became position 20hex for the same reason many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits The committee decided it was important to support upper case 64character alphabets and chose to pattern ASCII so it could be reduced easily to a usable 64character set of graphic codes Lower case letters were therefore not interleaved with upper case To keep options available for lower case letters and other graphics the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters and the letter A was placed in position 41hex to match the draft of the corresponding British standard The digits 09 were arranged so they correspond to values in binary prefixed with 011 making conversion with binarycoded decimal straightforwardMany of the nonalphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters Thus   and  were placed to correspond to 3 4 and 5 in the adjacent column The parentheses could not correspond to 9 and 0 however because the place corresponding to 0 was taken by the space character Since many European typewriters placed the parentheses with 8 and 9 those corresponding positions were chosen for the parentheses The  symbol was not used in continental Europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented  in the French variation so the  was placed in position 40hex next to the letter AThe control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message SOM end of address EOA end of message EOM end of transmission EOT who are you WRU are you RU a reserved device control DC0 synchronous idle SYNC and acknowledge ACK These were positioned to maximize the Hamming distance between their bit patternsWith the other special characters and control codes filled in ASCII was published as ASA X341963 leaving 28 code positions without any assigned meaning reserved for future standardization and one unassigned control code There was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lower case alphabet The indecision did not last long during May 1963 the CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet proposed to assign lower case characters to columns 6 and 7 Brief Report Meeting of CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet May 1315 1963 and International Organization for Standardization TC 97 SC 2 voted during October to incorporate the change into its draft standard Report of ISOTC97SC 2  Meeting of October 2931 1963 The X324 task group voted its approval for the change to ASCII at its May 1963 meeting Report on Task Group X324 June 11 1963 Pentagon Building Washington DC Locating the lowercase letters in columns 6 and 7 caused the characters

President Lyndon B Johnson mandated that all computers purchased by the United States federal government support ASCII statingI have also approved recommendations of the Secretary of Commerce regarding standards for recording the Standard Code for Information Interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operationsAll computers and related equipment configurations brought into the Federal Government inventory on and after July 1 1969 must have the capability to use the Standard Code for Information Interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used Lyndon B Johnson March 11 1968 Memorandum Approving the Adoption by the Federal Government of a Standard Code for Information Interchange The American Presidency Project Accessed 20080414 Other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as ISOIEC 646 that are identical or nearly identical to ASCII with extensions for characters outside the English alphabet and symbols used outside the United States such as the symbol for the United Kingdoms pound sterling  Almost every country needed an adapted version of ASCII since ASCII suited the needs of only the USA and a few other countries For example Canada had its own version that supported French characters Other adapted encodings include ISCII India VISCII Vietnam and YUSCII Yugoslavia Although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ASCII true ASCII is defined strictly only by ANSI standardASCII was incorporated into the Unicode character set as the first 128 symbols so the ASCII characters have the same numeric codes in both sets This allows UTF8 to be backward compatible with ASCII a significant advantageASCII control charactersASCII reserves the first 32 codes numbers 031 decimal for control characters codes originally intended not to represent printable information but rather to control devices such as printers that make use of ASCII or to provide metainformation about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape For example character 10 represents the line feed function which causes a printer to advance its paper and character 8 represents backspace RFC 2822 refers to control characters that do not include carriage return line feed or white space as nonwhitespace control characters RFC 2822 April 2001 NOWSCTL Except for the control characters that prescribe elementary lineoriented formatting ASCII does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document Other schemes such as markup languages address page and document layout and formattingThe original ASCII standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character The ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a data stream and sometimes accidental such as what delete meansProbably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the Teletype Model 33 ASR which was a printing terminal with an available paper tape readerpunch option Paper tape was a very popular medium for longterm program storage until the 1980s less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape In particular the Teletype Model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 ControlQ DC1 also known as XON 19 ControlS DC3 also known as XOFF and 127 Delete became de facto standards Because the keytop for the O key also showed a leftarrow symbol from ASCII1963 which had this character instead of underscore a noncompliant use of code 15 ControlO Shift In interpreted as delete previous character was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglectedThe use of ControlS XOFF an abbreviation for transmit off as a handshaking signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow and ControlQ XON transmit on to resume sending persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique On some systems ControlS retains its meaning but ControlQ is replaced by a second ControlS to resume outputCode 127 is officially named delete but the Teletype label was rubout Since the original standard did not give detailed interpretation for most control codes interpretations of this code varied The original Teletype meaning and the intent of the standard was to make it an ignored character the same as NUL all zeroes This was useful specifically for paper tape because punching the allones bit pattern on top of an existing mark would obliterate it Tapes designed to be hand edited could even be produced with spaces of extra NULs blank tape so that a block of characters could be rubbed out and then replacements put into the empty spaceAs video terminals began to replace printing ones the value of the rubout character was lost DEC systems for example interpreted Delete to mean remove the character before the cursor and this interpretation also became common in Unix systems Most other systems used Backspace for that meaning and used Delete to mean remove the character at the cursor That latter interpretation is the most common nowMany more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones The escape character ESC code 27 for example was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning This is the same meaning of escape encountered in URL encodings C language strings and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning Over time this meaning has been coopted and has eventually been changed In modern use an ESC sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence usually in the form of a socalled ANSI escape code or more properly a Control Sequence Introducer beginning with ESC followed by a  leftbracket character An ESC sent from the terminal is most often used as an outofband character used to terminate an operation as in the TECO and vi text editors In graphical user interface GUI and windowing systems ESC generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to exit terminate altogetherThe inherent ambiguity of many control characters combined with their historical usage created problems when transferring plain text files between systems The best example of this is the newline problem on various operating systems Teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both Carriage Return which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line and Line Feed which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead The name Carriage Return comes from the fact that on a manual typewriter the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the keys struck the ribbon remained stationary The entire carriage had to be pushed returned to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next lineDEC operating systems OS8 RT11 RSX11 RSTS TOPS10 etc used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device originally Teletype machines would work By the time socalled glass TTYs later called CRTs or terminals came along the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention When Gary Kildall cloned RT11 to create CPM he followed established DEC convention Until the introduction of PCDOS in 1981 IBM had no hand in this because their 1970s operating systems used EBCDIC instead of ASCII and they were oriented toward punchcard input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless IBMs PCDOS also marketed as MSDOS by Microsoft inherited the convention by virtue of being a clone of CPM and Windows inherited it from MSDOSUnfortunately requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone To simplify matters plain text data streams including files on Multics used line feed LF alone as a line terminator Unix and Unixlike systems and Amiga systems adopted this convention from Multics The original Macintosh OS Apple DOS and ProDOS on the other hand used carriage return CR alone as a line terminator however since Apple replaced it with the Unixbased OS X operating system they now use line feed LF as wellComputers attached to the ARPANET included machines running operating systems such as TOPS10 and TENEX using CRLF line endings machines running operating systems such as Multics using LF line endings and machines running operating systems such as OS360 that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and that used EBCDIC rather than ASCII The Telnet protocol defined an ASCII Network Virtual Terminal NVT so that connections between hosts with different lineending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network it used ASCII along with CRLF line endings and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the NVT The File Transfer Protocol adopted the Telnet protocol including use of the Network Virtual Terminal for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ASCII mode This adds complexity to implementations of those protocols and to other network protocols such as those used for Email and the World Wide Web on systems not using the NVTs CRLF lineending convention EOL translation plan for Mercurial Older operating systems such as TOPS10 along with CPM tracked file length only in units of disk blocks and used ControlZ SUB to mark the end of the actual text in the file For this reason EOF or endoffile was used colloquially and conventionally as a threeletter acronym TLA for ControlZ instead of SUBstitute For a variety of reasons the endoftext code ETX aka ControlC was inappropriate and using Z as the control code to end a file is analogous to it ending the alphabet a very convenient mnemonic aid An historic common and still prevalent convention uses the ETX aka ControlC code convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream usually from a keyboardIn C library and Unix conventions the null character is used to terminate text strings such nullterminated strings can be known in abbreviation as ASCIZ or ASCIIZ where here Z stands for zeroASCII control code chart Binary Oct Dec Hex Abbr The Unicode

entered by pressing the key on some systems The ambiguity of Backspace is due to early terminals designed assuming the main use of the keyboard would be to manually punch paper tape while not connected to a computer To delete the previous character one had to back up the paper tape punch which for mechanical and simplicity reasons was a button on the punch itself and not the keyboard then type the rubout character They therefore placed a key producing rubout at the location used on typewriters for backspace When systems used these terminals and provided commandline editing they had to use the rubout code to perform a backspace and often did not interpret the backspace character they might echo H for backspace Other terminals not designed for paper tape made the key at this location produce Backspace and systems designed for these used that character to back up Since the delete code often produced a backspace effect this also forced terminal manufacturers to make any key produce something other than the Delete character ASCII printable charactersCodes 20hex to 7Ehex known as the printable characters represent letters digits punctuation marks and a few miscellaneous symbols

Meeting  September 14 and 15 September 18 1961 ASCII was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard ultimately published as ISOIEC 646 1972 which would share most characters in common but assign other locally useful characters to several code points reserved for national use However the four years that elapsed between the publication of ASCII1963 and ISOs first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967 R Marchal ISOTC 97  Computers and Information Processing Acceptance of Draft ISO Recommendation No 1052 December 22 1967 caused ASCIIs choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code pointsISOIEC 646 like ASCII was a 7bit character set It did not make any additional codes available so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries Escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text but they were rarely used so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and therefore which character a code represented and in general textprocessing systems could cope with only one variant anywayBecause the bracket and brace characters of ASCII were assigned to national use code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of ISOIEC 646 a German French or Swedish etc programmer using their national variant of ISOIEC 646 rather than ASCII had to write and thus read something such as ain instead of ain C trigraphs were created to solve this problem for ANSI C although their late introduction

spoken by about seven million people worldwide In addition to languages spoken today Afroasiatic includes several important ancient languages such as Ancient Egyptian Akkadian and Biblical HebrewEtymologyThe Afroasiatic language family was originally referred to as HamitoSemitic a term introduced in the 1860s by the German scholar Karl Richard Lepsius The name was later popularized by Friedrich Mller in his Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft Wien 187688 The term Afroasiatic often now spelled as AfroAsiatic was later coined by Maurice Delafosse 1914 However it did not come into general use until Joseph Greenberg 1963 formally proposed its adoption In doing so Greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that Afroasiatic was the only language family that was represented transcontinentally in both Africa and Asia Individual scholars have also called the family Erythraean Tucker 1966 and Lisramic Hodge 1972 In lieu of HamitoSemitic the Russian linguist Igor Diakonoff later suggested the term Afrasian meaning half African half Asiatic in reference to the geographic distribution of the phylums constituent languages The term HamitoSemitic remains in use in the academic traditions of some European countriesDistribution and branchesSome linguists proposals for grouping within AfroasiaticThe Afroasiatic language family is usually considered to include the following branches Berber Chadic Cushitic Egyptian Omotic SemiticWhile there is general agreement on these six families there are some points of disagreement among linguists who study Afroasiatic In particular The Omotic language branch is the most controversial member of Afroasiatic since the grammatical formatives which most linguists have given greatest weight in classifying languages in the family are either absent or distinctly wobbly Hayward 1995 Greenberg 1963 and others considered it a subgroup of Cushitic while others have raised doubts about it being part of Afroasiatic at all eg

its position within Afroasiatic among those who accept it due to the mixed appearance of the language and a paucity of research and data Harold Fleming 2006 proposes that Ongota constitutes a separate branch of Afroasiatic Harrassowitz Verlag  The Harrassowitz Publishing House Bonny Sands 2009 believes the most convincing proposal is by Sav and Tosco 2003 namely that Ongota is an East Cushitic language with a NiloSaharan substratum In other words the Ongota people would appear to have once spoken a NiloSaharan language but then shifted to speaking a Cushitic language while retaining some characteristics of their earlier NiloSaharan language  Beja is sometimes listed as a separate branch of Afroasiatic but is more often included in the Cushitic branch which has a high degree of internal diversity Whether the various branches of Cushitic actually form a language family is sometimes questioned but not their inclusion in Afroasiatic itself There is no consensus on the interrelationships of the five nonOmotic branches of Afroasiatic see Subgrouping below This situation is not unusual even among longestablished language families there are also many disagreements concerning the internal classification of the IndoEuropean languages for instance Meroitic has been proposed as an unclassified Afroasiatic language as it shares the phonotactics characteristic of the family but there is not enough evidence to secure a classificationClassification historyIn the 9th century the Hebrew grammarian Judah ibn Quraysh of Tiaret in Algeria was the first to link two branches of Afroasiatic together he perceived a relationship between Berber and Semitic He knew of Semitic through his study of Arabic Hebrew and AramaicIn the course of the 19th century Europeans also began suggesting such relationships In 1844 Theodor Benfey suggested a language family consisting of Semitic Berber and Cushitic calling the latter Ethiopic In the same year TN Newman suggested a relationship between Semitic and Hausa but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertaintyFriedrich Mller named the traditional HamitoSemitic family in 1876 in his Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft He defined it as consisting of a Semitic group plus a Hamitic group containing Egyptian Berber and Cushitic he excluded the Chadic group These classifications relied in part on nonlinguistic anthropological and racial arguments that have largely been discredited see Hamitic hypothesisLeo Reinisch 1909 proposed linking Cushitic and Chadic while urging a more distant affinity to Egyptian and Semitic thus foreshadowing Greenberg but his suggestion found little resonanceMarcel Cohen 1924 rejected the idea of a distinct Hamitic subgroup and included Hausa a Chadic language in his comparative HamitoSemitic vocabularyJoseph Greenberg 1950 strongly confirmed Cohens rejection of Hamitic added and subclassified the Chadic branch and proposed the new name Afroasiatic for the family Nearly all scholars have accepted Greenbergs classificationIn 1969 Harold Fleming proposed that what had previously been known as Western Cushitic is an independent branch of Afroasiatic

Erythrean He divides Omotic into two branches North Omotic and South Omotic He divides Erythrean into Cushitic comprising Beja Agaw and EastSouth Cushitic and North Erythrean comprising Chadic and Boreafrasian According to his classification Boreafrasian consists of Egyptian Berber and Semitic Vladimir Orel and Olga Stolbova 1995 group Berber with Semitic and Chadic with Egyptian They split up Cushitic into five or more independent branches of Afroasiatic viewing Cushitic as a Sprachbund rather than a language family Igor M Diakonoff 1996 subdivides Afroasiatic in two grouping Berber Cushitic and Semitic together as EastWest Afrasian ESA and Chadic with Egyptian as NorthSouth Afrasian NSA He excludes Omotic from Afroasiatic Lionel Bender 1997 groups Berber Cushitic and Semitic together as MacroCushitic He regards Chadic and Omotic as the branches of Afroasiatic most remote from the others Alexander Militarev 2000 on the basis of lexicostatistics groups Berber with Chadic and both more distantly with Semitic as against Cushitic and Omotic He places Ongota in South OmoticPosition among the worlds languagesAfroasiatic is one of the four language families of Africa identified by Joseph Greenberg in his book The Languages of Africa 1963 It is the only one that extends outside of Africa via the Semitic branchThere are no generally accepted relations between Afroasiatic and any other language family However several proposals grouping Afroasiatic with one or more other language families have been made The bestknown of these are the following Hermann Mller 1906 argued for a relation between Semitic and the IndoEuropean languages This proposal was accepted by some linguists eg Holger Pedersen and Louis Hjelmslev but has little currency today For a fuller account see IndoSemitic languages Apparently influenced by Mller a colleague of his at the University of Copenhagen Holger Pedersen included HamitoSemitic the term replaced by Afroasiatic in his proposed Nostratic macrofamily cf Pedersen 1931336338 which also included the IndoEuropean FinnoUgric Samoyed Turkish Mongolian Manchu and Yukaghir languages This inclusion was retained by subsequent Nostraticists starting with Vladislav IllichSvitych and Aharon Dolgopolsky Joseph Greenberg 20002002 did not reject a relationship of Afroasiatic to these other languages but he considered it more distantly related to them than they were to each other grouping instead these other languages in a separate macrofamily which he called Eurasiatic and to which he added Chukotian Gilyak Korean JapaneseRyukyuan EskimoAleut and Ainu Most recently Sergei Starostins school has accepted Eurasiatic as a subgroup of Nostratic with Afroasiatic Dravidian and Kartvelian in Nostratic outside of Eurasiatic An even larger Borean group would contain Nostratic as well as DenCaucasian and AustricDate of AfroasiaticThe earliest written evidence of an Afroasiatic language is an Ancient Egyptian inscription of c 3400 BC 5400 years ago Earliest Egyptian Glyphs Symbols on Gerzean pottery resembling Egyptian hieroglyphs date back to c 4000 BC suggesting a still earlier possible date This gives us a minimum date for the age of Afroasiatic However Ancient Egyptian is highly divergent from ProtoAfroasiatic Trombetti 1905 12 and considerable time must have elapsed in between them Estimates of the date at which the ProtoAfroasiatic language was spoken vary widely They fall within a range between approximately 7500 BC 9500 years ago and approximately 16000 BC 18000 years ago According to Igor M Diakonoff 1988 33n ProtoAfroasiatic was spoken c 10000 BC According to Christopher Ehret 2002 3536 ProtoAfroasiatic was spoken c 11000 BC at the latest and possibly as early as c 16000 BC These dates are older than dates associated with most other protolanguagesAfroasiatic UrheimatThe term Afroasiatic Urheimat Urheimat meaning original homeland in German refers to the hypothetical place where ProtoAfroasiatic speakers lived in a single linguistic community or complex of communities before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages Afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in the Middle East North Africa the Horn of Africa and parts of the SahelThere is no agreement on when and where this Urheimat existed though the language is generally believed to have originated somewhere in or near the region stretching from the LevantNear East Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of Semitic languages identifies an Early Bronze Age origin of

of Andorra Funk and Wagnalls Encyclopedia 1991  is a landlocked microstate in Southwestern Europe located in the eastern Pyrenees mountains and bordered by Spain and France It is the sixth smallest nation in Europe having an area of 468 km and an estimated population of 85000 in 2012 Its capital Andorra la Vella is the highest capital city in Europe at an elevation of 1023 m above sea level The official language is Catalan although Spanish Portuguese and French are also commonly spoken Created under a charter in 988 the present Principality was formed in 1278 It is known as a principality as it is a monarchy headed by two coprinces ndash the Bishop of Urgell and the President of FranceAndorra is a prosperous country mainly because of its tourism industry which services an estimated 102 million visitors annually Estadisticaad Departament dEstadstica Govern dAndorra and also because of its status as a tax haven It is not a member of the European Union but the euro is the de facto currency The people of Andorra have the 4th highest human life expectancy in the world  82 years at birth HistoryTradition holds that Charles the Great Charlemagne granted a charter to the Andorran people in return for fighting against the Moors Overlordship of the territory was by the Count of Urgell and eventually by the bishop of the Diocese of Urgell In 988 Borrell II Count of Urgell gave the Andorran valleys to the Diocese of Urgell in exchange for land in Cerdanya Since then the Bishop of Urgell based in Seu dUrgell has owned Andorra Before 1095 Andorra did not have any type of military protection and the Bishop of Urgell who knew that the Count of Urgell wanted to reclaim the Andorran valleys asked for help and protection from the Lord of Caboet In 1095 the Lord of Caboet and the Bishop of Urgell signed under oath a declaration of their cosovereignty over Andorra Arnalda daughter of Arnau of Caboet married the Viscount of Castellb and both became Viscounts of Castellb and Cerdanya Years later their daughter Ermessenda married Roger Bernat II the French Count of Foix They became Roger Bernat II and Ermessenda I Counts of Foix Viscounts of Castellb and Cerdanya and also cosovereigns of Andorra shared with the Bishop of UrgellIn the 11th century a dispute arose between the Bishop of Urgell and the Count of Foix The conflict was resolved in 1278 with the mediation of Aragon by the signing of the first parage which provided that Andorras sovereignty be shared between the count of Foix whose title would ultimately transfer to the French head of state and the Bishop of Urgell in Catalonia This gave the principality its territory and political formOver the years the cotitle to Andorra passed to the kings of Navarre After Henry of Navarre became King Henry IV of France he issued an edict in 1607 that established the head of the French state and the Bishop of Urgell as coprinces of Andorra In 181213 the First French Empire annexed Catalonia and divided it in four dpartements with Andorra being made part of the district of Puigcerd dpartement of Sgre20th centuryAndorra declared war on Imperial Germany during World War I but did not actually take part in the fighting It remained in an official state of belligerency until 1958 as it was not included in the Treaty of VersaillesIn 1933 France occupied Andorra as a result of social unrest before elections On July 12 1934 adventurer Boris Skossyreff issued a proclamation in Urgell declaring himself Boris I King of Andorra simultaneously declaring war on the Bishop of Urgell He was arrested by Spanish authorities on July 20 and ultimately expelled from Spain From 1936 to 1940 a French detachment was garrisoned in Andorra to prevent influences of the Spanish Civil War and Francoist Spain Francoist troops reached the Andorran border in the later stages of the war During World War II Andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between Vichy France and SpainGiven its relative isolation Andorra has existed outside the mainstream of European history with few ties to countries other than France and Spain In recent times however its thriving tourist industry along with developments in transport and communications have removed the country from its isolation Its political system was modernised in 1993 when it became a member of the United Nations and the Council of EuropePoliticsAndorra is a parliamentary coprincipality with the President of France and the Bishop of Urgell Catalonia Spain as coprinces This peculiarity makes the President of France in his capacity as Prince of Andorra an elected reigning monarch even though he is not elected by a popular vote of the Andorran people The politics of Andorra take place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democracy whereby the Prime Minister of Andorra is the head of government and of a pluriform multiparty systemThe current Prime Minister is Antoni Mart of the Democrats for Andorra DA

Council consists of between 28 and 42 Councillors as the members of the legislative branch are called The Councillors serve for fouryear terms and elections are held between the thirtieth and fortieth days following the dissolution of the previous Council The Councillors can be elected on two equal constituenciesHalf are elected in equal number from each of the seven administrative parishes and the other half of the Councillors are elected from a single national constituency 15 days after the election the Councillors hold their inauguration During this session the Syndic General who is the head of the General Council and the Subsyndic General his assistant are elected Eight days later the Council convenes once more During this session the Head of Government the Prime Minister of Andorra is chosen from among the CouncillorsCasa de la Vall Andorran ParliamentCandidates for the primeministerial nomination can be proposed by a minimum of onefifth of the Councillors The Council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be Head of Government The Syndic General then notifies the Coprinces who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the Prime Minister of Andorra The General Council is also responsible for proposing and passing laws Bills may be presented to the Council as Private Members Bills by three of the Local Parish Councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of AndorraThe Council also approves the annual budget of the principality The government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the previous budget expires If the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved Once any bill is approved the Syndic General is responsible for presenting it to the Coprinces so that they may sign and enact itIf the Head of Government is not satisfied with the Council he may request that the Coprinces dissolve the Council and order new elections In turn the Councillors have the power to remove the Head of Government from office After a motion of censure is approved by at least onefifth of the Councillors the Council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes the Prime Minister is removedLaw and criminal justiceThe judiciary is composed of the Magistrates Court the Criminal Law Court the High Court of Andorra and the Constitutional Court The High Court of Justice is composed of five judges one appointed by the Head of Government one each by the Coprinces one by the Syndic General and one by the Judges and Magistrates It is presided over by the member appointed by the Syndic General and the judges hold office for sixyear termsThe Magistrates and Judges are appointed by the High Court and so is the President of the Criminal Law Court The High Court also appoints members of the Office of the Attorney General The Constitutional Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and reviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties It is composed of four judges one appointed by each of the Coprinces and two by the General Council They serve eightyear terms The Court is presided over by one of the Judges on a twoyear rotation so that each judge at one point will be the leader of the CourtForeign relations defence and securityAndorra does not have its own armed forces although there is a small ceremonial Army Responsibility for defending the nation rests primarily with France and Spain However in case of emergencies or natural disasters the Sometent an alarm is called and all ablebodied men between 21 and 60 of Andorran nationality must serve This is why all Andorrans and especially the head of each house usually the eldest ablebodied man of a house should by law keep a rifle even though the law also states that the police will offer a firearm in case of need Andorra is a full member of the United Nations UN the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE and has a special agreement with the European Union EUMilitaryAndorra has a small army which has historically been raised or reconstituted at various dates but has never in modern times amounted to a standing army The basic principle of Andorran defence is that all ablebodied men are available to fight if called upon by the sounding of the Sometent The duties of the Andorran Army are entirely ceremonialIn the modern era the army has consisted of a very small body of volunteers willing to undertake ceremonial duties Uniforms were handed down from generation to generation within families and communities Despite not being involved in any fighting Andorra was technically the longest combatant in the First World War as the country was left out of the Versailles Peace Conference and technically remained at war with Germany from 1914 until 1939 The armys role in internal security was largely taken over by the formation of the Police Corps of Andorra in 1931 Brief civil disorder associated with the elections of 1933 led to assistance being sought from the French police with a detachment resident in Andorra for two months under the command of RenJules Baulard The Andorran Army was reformed in the following year with eleven soldiers appointed to supervisory roles The force consisted of six Corporals one for each parish although there are currently seven parishes there were only six until 1978 plus four junior staff officers to coordinate action and a commander with the rank of Major It was the responsibility of the six corporals each in his own parish to be able to raise a fighting force from among the ablebodied men of the parishToday a small 12man ceremonial unit remains the only permanent section of the Andorran army but all ablebodied men remain technically available for military service with a requirement for each family to have access to a firearm The army has not fought for more than 700 years and its main responsibility is to present the Andorran flag at official ceremonial functions According to Marc Forn Moln Andorras military budget is strictly from voluntary donations and the availability of fulltime voluntaries The myth that all members of the Andorran Army are ranked as officers is popularly maintained in many works of reference An example from the United States State Department website An alternative example of the report In reality all those serving in the permanent ceremonial reserve hold ranks as officers or noncommissioned officers because the other ranks are considered to be the rest of the ablebodied male population who may still be called upon by the Sometent to serve although such a call has not been made in modern timesGIPAThe Grup dIntervenci Policia dAndorra GIPA is a small special forces unit trained in counterterrorism and hostage recovery tasks Although it is the closest in style to an active military force it is part of the Police Corps and not the Army As terrorist and hostage situations are a rare threat to the nation the GIPA is commonly assigned to prisoner escort duties and at other times to routine policing Police structures detailed here Police CorpsAndorra maintains a small but modern and wellequipped internal police force with around 240 police officers supported by civilian assistants The principal services supplied by the Corps are uniformed community policing criminal detection border control and traffic policing There are also small specialist units including police dogs mountain rescue and bomb disposal Fire BrigadeThe Andorran Fire Brigade with headquarters at Santa Coloma operates from four modern fire stations and has a staff of around 120 firefighters The service is equipped with 16 heavy appliances fire tenders turntable ladders and specialist fourwheel drive vehicles 4 light support vehicles cars and vans and 4 ambulances Historically the families of the six ancient parishes of Andorra maintained local arrangements to assist each other in fighting fires The first fire pump purchased by the government was acquired in 1943 The serious fires which lasted for two days in parts of the principality in December 1959 led to calls for a permanent fire service and the Andorran Fire Brigade was formed on 21 April 1961 The fire service maintains fulltime cover with five fire crews on duty at any time  two at the

and its counterpart the National Football Conference NFC currently contain 16 teams each making up the 32 teams of the NFLThe American Football Conference originated as the American Football League AFL with which the NFL combined in the AFLNFL merger of 1970 Ten AFC teams originally formed the AFL while three others were NFL teams that were added to the AFC to equalize the number of franchises and another three are more recent expansion teams one the Houston Texans plays in the market from which one of the AFLs founding teams now known as the Tennessee Titans originatedCurrent teamsSince 2002 the AFC has 16 teams organized into four divisions each with four teams East North South and West Division Team CityTown Stadium  East Buffalo Bills Orchard Park NY Ralph Wilson Stadium and

yellow once for a total of 16 gamesEach AFC team plays the other teams in its division twice home and away during the regular season in addition to 10 other games assigned to their schedule by the NFL the previous May Two of these games are assigned on the basis of the teams final division standing in the previous season The remaining 8 games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions This assignment shifts each year For instance in the 2007 regular season each team in the AFC West played one game against each team in both the AFC South and the NFC North In this way division competition consists of common opponents with the exception of the 2 games assigned on the strength of each teams prior division standing ie the division winner will face the other two division winners in the AFC divisions that they are not scheduled to play The NFC operates according to the same systemAt the end of each football season there are playoff games involving the top six teams in the AFC the four division champions by place standing and the top two remaining nondivisionchampion teams wild cards by record The last two teams remaining play in the AFC Championship game with the winner receiving the Lamar Hunt Trophy The AFC champion plays the NFC champion in the Super Bowl After Super Bowl XLVI the AFC has won 19 Super Bowls to the 24 won by the NFC Since losing 13 consecutive Super Bowls in the 1980s and 1990s XIXndashXXXI the AFC has won 9 of the last 15 The coach of the team with the best record that lost in the AFC Divisional round is the coach of the Pro BowlHistoryAmerican Football Conference logo From 1970 to 2009The AFC was created after the NFL merged with the American Football League AFL in 1970 All of the 10 former AFL teams along with the NFLs Cleveland Browns Pittsburgh Steelers and the thenBaltimore Colts joined the AFC The two AFL divisions AFL East and AFL West were more or less intactSince the merger five expansion teams have joined the AFC and two have left thus making the current total 16 When the Seattle Seahawks and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers joined the league in 1976 they were temporarily placed in the NFC and AFC respectively This arrangement lasted for one season only before the two teams switched conferences The Seahawks eventually returned to the NFC as a result of the 2002 realignment The expansion Jacksonville Jaguars joined the AFC in 1995Due to the relocation controversy of the Cleveland Browns a new AFC franchise called the Baltimore Ravens was officially established in 1996 while the Browns were reactivated in 1999The Houston Texans were then added to the league in 2002 joining the AFCBetween 2003 and 2012 the AFC had sent either the Indianapolis Colts the New England Patriots or the Pittsburgh Steelers to the Super Bowl with two exceptions In the 2002 NFL season the Oakland Raiders lost to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl XXXVII and in the 2012 NFL season the Baltimore Ravens prevailed over New England in the conference championship to reach Super Bowl XLVII By contrast the NFC sent a different team each year save for the 2011 NFL season when the New York Giants made it to their second Super Bowl in that same time span Super Bowl XLVILogoOriginal American Football Conference logoThe merged league created a new logo for the AFC that took elements of the old AFL logo specifically the A and the six stars surrounding it The AFC logo basically remained unchanged from 1970 to 2009 The 2010 NFL season introduced an updated AFC logo with the most notable revision being the removal of two stars leaving four representing the four divisions of the AFC and moving the stars inside the letter similar to the NFC logo NotesConference
aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvQW1waGliaWFu,The worlds smallest known vertebrate Paedophryne amauensis sitting on a US dime 179 mm for scaleAmphibians are ectothermic tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia They inhabit a wide variety of habitats with most species living within terrestrial fossorial arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems Amphibians typically start out as larva living in water but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult airbreathing form with lungs Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely upon skin They are superficially similar to reptiles but along with mammals and birds reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins amphibians are often ecological indicators and in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globeThe earliest amphibians evolved in the Devonian Period from sarcopterygian fish with lungs and bonylimbed fins features that were helpful in adapting to dry land They diversified and became dominant during the Carboniferous and Permian periods but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates Over time amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity leaving only the modern subclass Lissamphibia The three modern orders of amphibians are Anura the frogs and toads CaudataUrodela the salamanders and GymnophionaApoda the caecilians The total number of known amphibian species is approximately 7000 of which nearly 90 are frogs The smallest amphibian and vertebrate in the world is a frog from New Guinea Paedophryne amauensis with a length of just 77 mm The largest living amphibian is the 18 m Chinese Giant Salamander Andrias davidianus but this is dwarfed by the extinct 9 m Prionosuchus from the middle Permian of Brazil The study of amphibians is called batrachology while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called herpetology Evolution The first major groups of amphibians developed in the Devonian period around 370 million years ago from lobefinned fish similar to the modern coelacanth and lungfish which had evolved multijointed leglike fins with digits that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom Some fish had developed primitive lungs to help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the Devonian swamps were low in oxygen They could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves out of the water and onto dry land if circumstances so required Eventually their bony fins would evolve into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods including modern amphibians reptiles birds and mammals Despite being able to crawl on land many of these prehistoric tetrapodomorph fish still spent most of their time in the water They had started to develop lungs but still breathed predominantly with gills Ichthyostega was one of the first primitive amphibians with nostrils and more efficient lungs It had four sturdy limbs a neck a tail with fins and a skull very similar to that of the lobefinned fish Eusthenopteron Amphibians evolved adaptations that allowed them to stay out of the water for longer periods Their lungs improved and their skeletons became heavier and stronger better able to cope with the increased gravitational effect of life on land They developed hands and feet with five or more digits the skin became more capable of retaining body fluids and resisting desiccation The fishs hyomandibula bone in the hyoid region behind the gills diminished in size and became the stapes of the amphibian ear an adaptation necessary for hearing on dry land An affinity between the amphibians and the teleost fish is the multifolded structure of the teeth and the paired supraoccipital bones at the back of the head neither of these features being found elsewhere in the animal kingdom The Permian lepospondyl Diplocaulus was largely aquaticAt the end of the Devonian period 360 million years ago the seas rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates though some such as Ichthyostega may have sometimes hauled themselves out of the water It is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs dragging their hindquarters in a similar manner to that used by the elephant seal In the early Carboniferous 360 to 345 million years ago the climate became wet and warm Extensive swamps developed with mosses ferns horsetails and calamites Airbreathing arthropods evolved and invaded the land where they provided food for the carnivorous amphibians that began to adapt to the terrestrial environment There were no other tetrapods on the land and the amphibians were at the top of the food chain occupying the ecological position currently held by the crocodile Though equipped with limbs and the ability to breathe air most still had a long tapering body and strong tail They were the top land predators sometimes reaching several metres in length preying on the large insects of the period and the many types of fish in the water They still needed to return to water to lay their shellless eggs and even most modern amphibians have a fully aquatic larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors It was the development of the amniotic egg which prevents the developing embryo from drying out that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their dominance in the period that followed During the Triassic Period 250 to 200 million years ago the reptiles began to outcompete the amphibians leading to a reduction in both the amphibians size and their importance in the biosphere According to the fossil record Lissamphibia which includes all modern amphibians and is the only surviving lineage may have branched off from the extinct groups Temnospondyli and Lepospondyli at some period between the Late Carboniferous and the Early Triassic The relative scarcity of fossil evidence precludes precise dating but the most recent molecular study based on multilocus sequence typing suggests a Late CarboniferousEarly Permian origin of extant amphibians The temnospondyl Eryops had sturdy limbs to support its body on landThe origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians is a matter of debate A 2005 molecular phylogeny based on rDNA analysis suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs It also appears that the divergence of the three groups took place in the Paleozoic or early Mesozoic around 250 million years ago before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea and soon after their divergence from the lobefinned fish The briefness of this period and the swiftness with which radiation took place would help account for the relative scarcity of primitive amphibian fossils There are large gaps in the fossil record but the discovery of a protofrog from the Early Permian in Texas in 2008 provided a missing link with many of the characteristics of modern frogs Molecular analysis suggests that the frogsalamander divergence took place considerably earlier than the palaeontological evidence indicates As they evolved from lunged fish amphibians had to make certain adaptations for living on land including the need to develop new means of locomotion In the water the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward but on land quite different mechanisms were required Their vertebral columns limbs limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding Terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of air They needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature They developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment Their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water The skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss Classification The word Amphibian is derived from the Ancient Greek term  amphbios which means both kinds of life  meaning of both kinds and  meaning life The term was initially used as a general adjective for animals that could live on land or in water including seals and otters Traditionally the class Amphibia includes all tetrapod vertebrates that are not amniotes Amphibia in its widest sense sensu lato was divided into three subclasses two of which are extinct  Subclass Labyrinthodontia diverse Paleozoic and early Mesozoic group Subclass Lepospondyli small Paleozoic group sometimes included in the Labyrinthodontia which may actually be more closely related to amniotes than Lissamphibia Subclass Lissamphibia all modern amphibians including frogs toads salamanders newts and caecilians Order Anura frogs and toads Jurassic to present5602 current species in 48 families Order Caudata or Urodela salamanders newts Jurassic to present571 current species in 10 families Order Gymnophiona or Apoda caecilians Jurassic to present190 current species in 10 familiesTriadobatrachus massinoti a protofrog from the Early Triassic of MadagascarThe actual number of species in each group depends on the taxonomic classification followed The two most common systems are the classification adopted by the website AmphibiaWeb University of California Berkeley and the classification by herpetologist Darrel Frost and the American Museum of Natural History available as the online reference database Amphibian Species of the World The numbers of species cited above follow Frost and the total number of known amphibian species is approximately 7000 of which nearly 90 are frogs With the phylogenetic classification the taxon Labyrinthodontia has been discarded as it is a paraphyletic group without unique defining features apart from shared primitive characteristics Classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether they use a stembased or a nodebased classification Traditionally amphibians as a class are defined as all tetrapods with a larval stage while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians frogs salamanders and caecilians and all their descendants is called Lissamphibia The phylogeny of Paleozoic amphibians is uncertain and Lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups like the Temnospondyli traditionally placed in the subclass Labyrinthodontia or the Lepospondyli and in some analyses even in the amniotes This means that advocates of phylogenetic nomenclature have removed a large number of basal Devonian and Carboniferous amphibiantype tetrapod groups that were formerly placed in Amphibia in Linnaean taxonomy and included them elsewhere under cladistic taxonomy If the common ancestor of amphibians and amniotes is included in Amphibia it becomes a paraphyletic group All modern amphibians are included in the subclass Lissamphibia which is usually considered a clade a group of species that have evolved from a common ancestor The three modern orders are Anura the frogs and toads Caudata or Urodela the salamanders and Gymnophiona or Apoda the caecilians It has been suggested that salamanders arose separately from a Temnospondyllike ancestor and even that caecilians are the sister group of the advanced reptiliomorph amphibians and thus of amniotes Although the fossils of several older protofrogs with primitive characteristics are known the oldest true frog is Prosalirus bitis from the Early Jurassic Kayenta Formation of Arizona It is anatomically very similar to modern frogs The oldest known caecilian is another Early Jurassic species Eocaecilia micropodia and is also from Arizona The earliest salamander is Beiyanerpeton jianpingensis from the Late Jurassic of northeastern China Authorities disagree as to whether Salientia is a superorder that includes the order Anura or whether Anura is a suborder of the order Salientia The Lissamphibia are traditionally divided into three orders but an extinct salamanderlike family the Albanerpetontidae is now considered part of the Lissamphibia alongside the superorder Salientia Furthermore Salientia includes all three recent orders plus the Triassic protofrog Triadobatrachus  Characteristics The superclass Tetrapoda is divided into four classes of vertebrate animals with four limbs Reptiles birds and mammals are amniotes the eggs of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes some of which are impervious Lacking these membranes amphibians require water bodies for reproduction although some species have developed various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable aquatic larval stage They are not found in the sea with the exception of one or two frogs that live in brackish water in mangrove swamps On land amphibians are restricted to moist habitats because of the need to keep their skin dampThe smallest amphibian and vertebrate in the world is a microhylid frog from New Guinea Paedophryne amauensis first discovered in 2012 It has an average length of 77 mm and is part of a genus which contains four of the worlds ten smallest frog species The largest living amphibian is the 18 m Chinese Giant Salamander Andrias davidianus but this is a great deal smaller than the largest amphibian that ever existedthe extinct 9 m Prionosuchus a crocodilelike temnospondyl dating to 270 million years ago from the middle Permian of Brazil The largest frog is the African Goliath frog Conraua goliath which can reach 32 cm and weigh 3 kg Amphibians are ectothermic coldblooded vertebrates that do not maintain their body temperature through internal physiological processes Their metabolic rate is low and as a result their food and energy requirements are limited In the adult state they have tear ducts and movable eyelids and most species have ears that can detect airborne or ground vibrations They have muscular tongues which in many species can be protruded Modern amphibians have fully ossified vertebrae with articular processes Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae Their skulls are mostly broad and short and are often incompletely ossified Their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales apart from a few fishlike scales in certain caecilians The skin contains many mucous glands and in some species poison glands The hearts of amphibians have three chambers two atria and one ventricle They have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea Most amphibians lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults Amphibians breathe by means of a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat They supplement this with gas exchange through the skin Anura Redeyed tree frog Agalychnis callidryas with limbs and feet specialised for climbingThe order Anura from the Latin an meaning without and the Ancient Greek oura meaning tail comprises the frogs and toads They usually have long hind limbs that fold underneath them shorter forelimbs webbed toes with no claws no tails large eyes and glandular moist skin Members of this order with smooth skins are commonly referred to as frogs while those with warty skins are known as toads The difference is not a formal one taxonomically and there are numerous exceptions to this rule Members of the family Bufonidae are known as the true toads Frogs range in size from the 30 cm goliath frog Conraua goliath of West Africa to the 77 mm Paedophryne amauensis first described in Papua New Guinea in 2012 which is also the smallest known vertebrate Although most species are associated with water and damp habitats some are specialised to live in trees or in deserts They are found worldwide except for polar areas Anura is divided into three suborders that are broadly accepted by the scientific community but the relationships between some families remain unclear Future molecular studies should provide further insights into their evolutionary relationships The suborder Archaeobatrachia contains four families of primitive frogs These are Ascaphidae Bombinatoridae Discoglossidae and Leiopelmatidae which have few derived features and are probably paraphyletic with regard to other frog lineages The six families in the more evolutionarily advanced suborder Mesobatrachia consist of the fossorial Megophryidae Pelobatidae Pelodytidae Scaphiopodidae and Rhinophrynidae and the obligatorily aquatic Pipidae These have certain characteristics that are intermediate between the two other suborders Neobatrachia is by far the largest suborder and includes the remaining families of modern frogs including most common species 96 of the over 5000 extant species of frog are neobatrachians  Caudata Japanese giant salamander Andrias japonicus a primitive salamanderThe order Caudata from the Latin cauda meaning tail consists of the salamandersmdashelongated lowslung animals that mostly resemble lizards in form This is a symplesiomorphic trait and they are no more closely related to lizards than they are to mammals Salamanders lack claws have scalefree skins either smooth or covered with tubercles and tails that are usually flattened from side to side and often finned They range in size from the Chinese giant salamander Andrias davidianus which has been reported to grow to a length of 18 m to the diminutive Thorius pennatulus from Mexico which seldom exceeds 20 mm in length Salamanders are distributed widely in the Holarctic region of the northern hemisphere The family Plethodontidae is also found in Central America and South America north of the Amazon Basin Urodela is a name sometimes used for all the extant species of salamanders Members of several families of salamanders have become paedomorphic and either fail to complete their metamorphosis or retain some larval characteristics as adults Most salamanders are under 15 cm long They may be terrestrial or aquatic and many spend part of the year in each habitat When on land they mostly spend the day hidden under stones or logs or in dense vegetation emerging in the evening and night to forage for worms insects and other invertebrates Danube crested newt Triturus dobrogicus an advanced salamanderThe suborder Cryptobranchoidea contains the primitive salamanders A number of fossil cryptobranchids have been found but there are only three living species the Chinese giant salamander Andrias davidianus the Japanese giant salamander Andrias japonicus and the hellbender Cryptobranchus alleganiensis from North America These large amphibians retain several larval characteristics in their adult state gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded A unique feature is their ability to feed by suction depressing either the left side of their lower jaw or the right The males excavate nests persuade females to lay their egg strings inside them and guard them As well as breathing with lungs they respire through the many folds in their thin skin which has capillaries close to the surface The suborder Salamandroidea contains the advanced salamanders They differ from the cryptobranchids by having fused prearticular bones in the lower jaw and by using internal fertilisation In salamandrids the male deposits a bundle of sperm the spermatophore and the female picks it up and inserts it into her cloaca where the sperm is stored until the eggs are laid The largest family in this group is Plethodontidae the lungless salamanders which includes 60 of all salamander species The family Salamandridae includes the true salamanders and the name newt is given to members of its subfamily PleurodelinaeThe third suborder Sirenoidea contains the four species of sirens which are in a single family Sirenidae Members of this order are eellike aquatic salamanders with much reduced forelimbs and no hind limbs Some of their features are primitive while others are derived Fertilisation is likely to be external as sirenids lack the cloacal glands used by male salamandrids to produce spermatophores and the females lack spermathecae for sperm storage Despite this the eggs are laid singly a behaviour not conducive for external fertilisation  Gymnophiona The limbless South American caecilian Siphonops paulensisThe order Gymnophiona from the Greek gymnos meaning naked and ophis meaning serpent or Apoda from the Latin an meaning without and the Greek poda meaning legs comprise the caecilians These are long cylindrical limbless animals with a snake or wormlike form The adults vary in length from 8 to 75 centimetres 3 to 30 inches with the exception of Thomsons caecilian Caecilia thompsoni which can reach 150 centimetres 5 feet A caecilians skin has a large number of transverse folds and in some species contains tiny embedded dermal scales It has rudimentary eyes covered in skin which are probably limited to discerning differences in light intensity It also has a pair of short tentacles near the eye that can be extended and which have tactile and olfactory functions Most caecilians live underground in burrows in damp soil in rotten wood and under plant debris but some are aquatic Most species lay their eggs underground and when the larvae hatch they make their way to adjacent bodies of water Others brood their eggs and the larvae undergo metamorphosis before the eggs hatch A few species give birth to live young nourishing them with glandular secretions while they are in the oviduct Caecilians are found in tropical Africa Asia and Central and South America  Anatomy and physiology  Skin The bright colours of the common reed frog Hyperolius viridiflavus show that it is a toxic speciesThe integumentary structure contains some typical characteristics common to terrestrial vertebrates such as the presence of highly cornified outer layers renewed periodically through a moulting process controlled by the pituitary and thyroid glands Local thickenings often called warts are common such as those found on toads The outside of the skin is shed periodically more or less in one piece in contrast to mammals and birds where it is shed in flakes Amphibians often eat the sloughed skin Caecilians are unique among amphibians in having mineralized dermal scales embedded in the dermis between the furrows in the skin The similarity of these to the scales of bony fish is largely superficial Lizards and some frogs have somewhat similar osteoderms forming bony deposits in the dermis but this is an example of convergent evolution with similar structures having arisen independently in diverse vertebrate lineages Amphibian skin is permeable to water Gas exchange can take place through the skin and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising to the surface of water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds To compensate for their thin and delicate skin amphibians have evolved mucous glands principally on their heads backs and tails The secretions produced by these help keep the skin moist In addition most species of amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or poisonous substances Some amphibian toxins can be lethal to humans while others have little effect The main poisonproducing glands the paratoids produce the neurotoxin bufotoxin and are located behind the ears of toads along the backs of frogs behind the eyes of salamanders and on the upper surface of caeciliansThe skin colour of amphibians is produced by three layers of pigment cells called chromatophores These three cell layers consist of the melanophores occupying the deepest layer the guanophores forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules producing a bluegreen colour and the lipophores yellow the most superficial layer The colour change displayed by many species is initiated by hormones secreted by the pituitary gland Unlike bony fish there is no direct control of the pigment cells by the nervous system and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than happens in fish A vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is a warning sign to predators  Skeletal system and locomotion Amphibians have a skeletal system that is structurally homologous to other tetrapods though with a number of variations They all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs The bones are hollow and lightweight The musculoskeletal system is strong to enable it to support the head and body The bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes The pectoral girdle is supported by muscle and the welldeveloped pelvic girdle is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs The ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammalsSkeleton of Surinam horned frogCeratophrys cornutaIn most amphibians there are four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot but no claws on either Some salamanders have fewer digits and the Amphiumas are eellike in appearance with tiny stubby legs The sirens are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs The caecilians are limbless They burrow in the manner of earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body On the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to sideIn frogs the hind legs are larger than the fore legs especially so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming In the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies The feet have adaptations for the way of life with webbing between the toes for swimming broad adhesive toe pads for climbing and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging frogs usually dig backwards into the soil In most salamanders the limbs are short and more or less the same length and project at right angles from the body Locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop particularly when climbing In their normal gait only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors the lobefinned fish Some salamanders in the genus Aneides and certain Plethodontids climb trees and have long limbs large toepads and prehensile tails In aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles the tail has dorsal and ventral fins and is moved from side to side as a means of propulsion Adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short onesSalamanders use their tails in defence and some are prepared to jettison them to save their lives in a process known as autotomy Certain species in the Plethodontidae have a weak zone at the base of the tail and use this strategy readily The tail often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape Both tails and limbs can be regenerated Adult frogs are unable to regrow limbs but tadpoles can do so Circulatory system The ringed caecilian Siphonops annulatus resembles an earthwormAmphibians have a juvenile stage and an adult stage and the circulatory systems of the two are distinct In the juvenile or tadpole stage the circulation is similar to that of a fish the twochambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated round the body and back to the heart in a single loop In the adult stage amphibians especially frogs lose their gills and develop lungs They have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria When the ventricle starts contracting deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs Continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood round the rest of the body Mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers Nervous and sensory systems The nervous system is basically the same as in other vertebrates with a central brain a spinal cord and nerves throughout the body The amphibian brain is less well developed than that of reptiles birds and mammals but is similar in morphology and function to that of a fish It consists of equal parts cerebrum midbrain and cerebellum Various parts of the cerebrum process sensory input such as smell in the olfactory lobe and sight in the optic lobe and it is additionally the centre of behaviour and learning The cerebellum is the centre of muscular coordination and the medulla oblongata controls some organ functions including heartbeat and respiration The brain sends signals through the spinal cord and nerves to regulate activity in the rest of the body The pineal body known to regulate sleep patterns in humans is thought to produce the hormones involved in hibernation and aestivation in amphibiansTadpoles retain the lateral line system of their ancestral fishes but this is lost in terrestrial adult amphibians Some caecilians possess electroreceptors that allow them to locate objects around them when submerged in water The e

to the east the Arctic Ocean to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the west and south with Russia further west across the Bering Strait Alaska is the largest state in the United States by area the 4th least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 United States Approximately half of Alaskas 731449 residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area Alaskas economy is dominated by the oil natural gas and fishing industries it has these resources in abundanceAlaska was purchased from Russia on March 30 1867 for 72 million  adjusted for inflation at approximately two cents per acre 474km The land went through several administrative changes before becoming an organized or incorporated territory on May 11 1912 and the 49th state of the US on January 3 1959 The name Alaska  was already introduced in the Russian colonial period when it was used only for the peninsula and is derived from the Aleut alaxsxaq meaning the mainland or more literally the object towards which the action of the sea is directed Ransom J Ellis 1940 Derivation of the Word Alaska American Anthropologist ns 42 pp 550551 It is also known as Alyeska the great land an Aleut word derived from the same rootGeographyAlaska has a longer coastline than all the other US states combined It is the only noncontiguous US state on continental North America about 500 mi of British Columbia Canada separates Alaska from Washington state Alaska is thus an exclave of the United States possibly the largest exclave in the world It is technically part of the continental US but is often not included in colloquial use Alaska is not part of the contiguous US often called the Lower 48 The other three exclaves of the United States are the Northwest Angle of Minnesota Point Roberts Washington and Alburgh

North Slope and of the Northwest Arctic seldom think of themselves as oneAleutian IslandsMore than 300 small volcanic islands make up this chain which stretches over 1200 mi into the Pacific Ocean The International Date Line was drawn west of 180 to keep the whole state and thus the entire North American continent within the same legal day However because some of these islands fall in the Eastern Hemisphere this makes Alaska the northernmost easternmost and westernmost state in the union with the southernmost state being Hawaii Two of the islands Attu and Kiska were occupied by Japanese forces

southern tip of the Alaska Peninsula Many active volcanoes are found in the Aleutians and in coastal regions Unimak Island for example is home to Mount Shishaldin which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to 10000 ft above the North Pacific It is the most perfect volcanic cone on Earth even more symmetrical than Japans Mount Fuji The chain of volcanoes extends to Mount Spurr west of

Land Management approximately 65 of Alaska is owned and managed by the US federal government as public lands including a multitude of national forests national parks and national wildlife refuges Of these the Bureau of Land Management manages 87 e6acre or 238 of the state The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service It is the worlds largest wildlife refuge comprising 16 e6acreOf the remaining land area the state of Alaska owns 101 e6acre its entitlement under the Alaska Statehood Act A portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to organized boroughs under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs Smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteadingrelated opportunities though these are infrequently popular due to the often remote and roadless locations The University of Alaska as a land grant university also owns substantial acreage which it manages independentlyAnother 44 e6acre are owned by 12 regional and scores of local Native corporations created under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act Regional Native corporation Doyon Limited often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in Alaska in advertisements and other communications Provisions of ANCSA allowing the corporations land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 1991 were repealed before they could take effect Effectively the corporations hold title including subsurface title in many cases a privilege denied to individual Alaskans but cannot sell the land Individual Native allotments can be and are sold on the open market howeverVarious private interests own the remaining land totaling about one percent of the state Alaska is by a large margin the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when Native corporation holdings are excludedClimateThe climate in Southeast Alaska is a midlatitude oceanic climate Kppen climate classification Cfb in the southern sections and a subarctic oceanic climate Kppen Cfc in the northern parts On an annual basis Southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of Alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year Juneau averages over 50 in of precipitation a year and Ketchikan averages over 150 in This is also the only region in Alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter monthsThe climate of Anchorage and south central Alaska is mild by Alaskan standards due to the regions proximity to the seacoast While the area gets less rain than southeast Alaska it gets more snow and days tend to be clearer On average Anchorage receives 16 in of precipitation a year with around 75 in of snow although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow It is a subarctic climate Kppen Dfc due to its brief cool summersBarrow Browerville neighborhood near Eben Hopson Middle School shown known colloquially for many years by the nickname Top of the World is the northernmost city in the United StatesThe climate of Western Alaska is determined in large part by the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska It is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north The temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is This region has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation An area stretching from the northern side of the Seward Peninsula to the Kobuk River valley is technically a desert with portions receiving less than 10 in of precipitation annually On the other extreme some locations between Dillingham and Bethel average around 100 in of precipitation The climate of the interior of Alaska is subarctic Some of the highest and lowest temperatures in Alaska occur around the area near Fairbanks The summers may have temperatures reaching into the 90s F the low to mid 30s C while in the winter the temperature can fall below 60 F Precipitation is sparse in the Interior often less than 10 in a year but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire winterThe highest and lowest recorded temperatures in Alaska are both in the Interior The highest is 100 F in Fort Yukon which is just 8 mi inside the arctic circle on June 27 1915 making Alaska tied with Hawaii as the state with the lowest high

arrival of European peoples to the area The Tlingit people developed a matrilineal society in what is today Southeast Alaska along with parts of British Columbia and the Yukon Also in Southeast were the Haida now well known for their unique arts The Tsimshian people came to Alaska from British Columbia in 1887 when President Grover Cleveland and later the US Congress granted them permission to settle on Annette Island and found the town of Metlakatla All three of these peoples as well as other indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid19th century with the most devastating epidemics arriving in the 1830s and 1860s Brian C Hosmer American Indians in the Marketplace Persistence and Innovation among the Menominees

1648 several koches of Semyon Dezhnyovs expedition were thrown to Alaska by storm and founded this settlement This hypothesis is based on the message of Chukchi geographer Nikolai Daurkin who had visited Alaska in 17641765 and reported about a village on the Kheuveren river populated by bearded men who pray to the icons Some modern researchers associate Kheuveren with Koyuk River The Russian settlement of St Pauls Harbor presentday Kodiak town Kodiak Island 1814It is usually assumed that the first European boat to reach Alaska was the St Gabriel under the authority of the surveyor M S Gvozdev and assistant navigator I Fyodorov on August 21 1732 during expedition of Siberian cossak A F Shestakov and Belorussian explorer D I Pavlutsky 17291735                 3  2000        1993 Another European contact with Alaska occurred in 1741 when Vitus Bering led an expedition for the Russian Navy aboard the St Peter After his crew returned to Russia with sea otter pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of Siberia towards the Aleutian islands The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1784 Between 1774 and 1800 Spain sent several expeditions to Alaska in order to assert its claim over the Pacific Northwest In 1789 a Spanish settlement and fort were built in Nootka Sound These expeditions gave names to places such as Valdez Bucareli Sound and Cordova Later the RussianAmerican Company carried out an expanded colonization program during the earlytomid19th centurySitka renamed New Archangel from 1804 to 1867 on Baranof Island in the Alexander Archipelago in what is now Southeast Alaska became the capital of Russian America and remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the United States The Russians never fully colonized Alaska and the colony was never very profitableWilliam H Seward the United States Secretary of State negotiated the Alaska Purchase also known as Sewards Folly with the Russians in 1867 for 72 million Alaska was loosely governed by the military initially and was administered as a district starting in 1884 with a governor appointed by the president of the United States as well as a district court headquartered in SitkaMiners and prospectors climb the Chilkoot Trail during the Klondike Gold RushFor most of Alaskas first decade under the American flag Sitka was the only community inhabited by American settlers They organized a provisional city government which was Alaskas first city government but not in a legal sense Legislation allowing Alaskan communities to legally incorporate as cities did not come about until 1900 and home rule for cities was extremely limited or unavailable until statehood took effectUS TerritoryStarting in the 1890s and stretching in some places to the early 1910s gold rushes in Alaska and the nearby Yukon Territory brought thousands of miners and settlers to Alaska Alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 1912 Alaskas capital which had been in Sitka until 1906 was moved north to Juneau and began to take shape with the construction of the Alaska Governors Mansion that same yearUS troops negotiate snow and ice during the Battle of Attu in May 1943During World War II the Aleutian Islands Campaign focused on the three outer Aleutian Islands  Attu Agattu and Kiska these three Aleutian outer islands are about 460 mi away from continental USSR 920 mi from continental Alaska US 950 mi from Japan  that were invaded by Japanese troops and occupied between June 1942 and August 1943 UnalaskaDutch Harbor became a significant base for the US Army Air Corps and Navy submarinersThe US LendLease program involved the flying of American warplanes through Canada to Fairbanks and thence Nome Soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft ferrying them to fight the German invasion of the Soviet Union The construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan citiesStatehoodStatehood for Alaska was an important cause of James Wickersham early in his tenure as a congressional delegate Decades later the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946 The Alaska Statehood Committee and Alaskas Constitutional Convention would soon follow Statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes mostly in the US Congress but also within Alaska Statehood was approved by Congress on July 7 1958 Alaska was officially proclaimed a state on January 3 1959On March 27 1964 the massive Good Friday Earthquake killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities mainly by the resultant tsunamis and landslides It was the third most powerful earthquake in the recorded history of the world with a moment magnitude of 92 It was over one thousand times more powerful than the 1989 San Francisco earthquake The time of day 536 pm time of year and location of the epicenter were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives particularly in AnchorageThe 1968 discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay and the 1977 completion of the TransAlaska Pipeline led to an oil boom Royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward That same year not coincidentally Alaska repealed its state income tax In 1989 the Exxon Valdez hit a reef in the Prince William Sound spilling over 11000000 USgal of crude oil over 1100 miles 1600 km of coastline Today the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife RefugeDemographicsThe United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Alaska was 731449 on July 1 2012 a 30 increase since the 2010 United States Census In 2010 Alaska ranked as the 47th state by population ahead of North Dakota Vermont and Wyoming and

Bering land bridgeReligionSt Michaels Russian Orthodox Cathedral in SitkaAlaska has been identified along with Pacific Northwest states Washington and Oregon as being the least religious in the US According to statistics collected by the Association of Religion Data Archives about 39 of Alaska residents were members of religious congregations Evangelical Protestants had 78070 members Roman Catholics had 54359 and mainline Protestants had 37156 After Catholicism the largest single denominations are The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints with 30169 and Southern Baptists with 22959 The large Eastern Orthodox with 49 parishes and up to 50000 followers population is a result of early Russian colonization and missionary work among Alaska Natives In 1795 the First Russian Orthodox Church was established in Kodiak Intermarriage with Alaskan Natives helped the Russian immigrants integrate into society As a result an increasing number of Russian Orthodox churches gradually became established within Alaska Alaska also has the largest Quaker population by percentage of any state In 2009 there were 6000 Jews in Alaska for whom observance of halakha may pose special problems

products used to sustain human life Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science Agriculture generally speaking refers to human activities although it is also observed in certain species of ant and termite The word agriculture is the English adaptation of Latin agricultra from ager a field Latin Word Lookup and cultra cultivation in the strict sense of tillage of the soil Latin Word Lookup Thus a literal reading of the word yields tillage of fieldsThe history of agriculture dates back thousands of years and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates cultures and technologies However all farming generally relies on techniques to expand and maintain the lands that are suitable for raising domesticated species For plants this usually requires some form of irrigation although there are methods of dryland farming pastoral herding on rangeland is still the most common means of raising livestock In the developed world industrial agriculture based on largescale monoculture has become the dominant system of modern farming although there is growing support for sustainable agriculture eg permaculture or organic agricultureUntil the Industrial Revolution the vast majority of the human population labored in agriculture Preindustrial agriculture was typically subsistence agriculture in which farmers raised most of their crops for their own consumption instead of for trade A remarkable shift in agricultural practices has occurred over the past century in response to new technologies and the development of world markets This also led to technological improvements in agricultural techniques such as the HaberBosch method for synthesizing ammonium nitrate which made the traditional practice of recycling nutrients with crop rotation and animal manure less necessaryModern agronomy plant breeding and agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers and technological improvements have sharply increased yields from cultivation but at the same time have caused widespread ecological damage and negative human health effects Selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry such as intensive pig farming have similarly increased the output of meat but have raised concerns about animal cruelty and the health effects of the antibiotics growth hormones and other chemicals commonly used in industrial meat production The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods fibers fuels and raw materials In the 21st century plants have been used to grow biofuels biopharmaceuticals bioplastics and pharmaceuticals Specific foods include cereals vegetables fruits and meat Fibers include cotton wool hemp silk and flax Raw materials include lumber and bamboo Other useful materials are produced by plants such as resins Biofuels include methane from biomass ethanol and biodiesel Cut flowers nursery plants tropical fish and birds for the pet trade are some of the ornamental products Regarding food production the World Bank targets agricultural food production and water management as an increasingly global issue that is fostering an important and growing debate In 2007 one third of the worlds workers were employed in agriculture The services sector has overtaken agriculture as the economic sector employing the most people worldwide Despite the size of its workforce agricultural production accounts for less than five percent of the gross world product an aggregate of all gross domestic products History A Sumerian harvesters sickle made from baked clay ca 3000 BCAgricultural practices such as irrigation crop rotation fertilizers pesticides and animals were developed long ago but have made great strides in the past century The history of agriculture has played a major role in human history as agricultural progress has been a crucial factor in worldwide socioeconomic change Division of labor in agricultural societies made commonplace specializations rarely seen in huntergatherer cultures So too are arts such as epic literature and monumental architecture as well as codified legal systems When farmers became capable of producing food beyond the needs of their own families others in their society were freed to devote themselves to projects other than food acquisition Historians and anthropologists have long argued that the development of agriculture made civilization possible The total world population probably never exceeded 15 million inhabitants before the development of agriculture LucNormand Tellier 2009 Urban world history an economic and geographical perspective PUQ p26

Egypt and India were sites of the earliest planned sowing and harvesting of plants that had previously been gathered in the wild Independent development of agriculture occurred in northern and

socalled Neolithic founder crops of agriculture appear first emmer wheat and einkorn wheat then hulled barley peas lentils bitter vetch chick peas and flaxBy 7000 BC smallscale agriculture reached Egypt From at least 7000 BC the Indian subcontinent saw farming of wheat and barley as attested by archaeological excavation at Mehrgarh in Balochistan in what is present day Pakistan By 6000 BC midscale farming was entrenched on the banks of the Nile This as irrigation had not yet matured sufficiently About this time agriculture was developed independently in the Far East with rice rather than wheat as the primary crop Chinese and Indonesian farmers went on to domesticate taro and beans including mung soy and azuki To complement these new sources of carbohydrates highly organized net fishing of rivers lakes and ocean shores in these areas brought in great volumes of essential protein Collectively these new methods of farming and fishing inaugurated a human population boom that dwarfed all previous expansions and continues todayThreshing of grain in ancient EgyptBy 5000 BC the Sumerians had developed core agricultural techniques including largescale intensive cultivation of land monocropping organized irrigation and the use of a specialized labor force Domestication of wild aurochs and mouflon into cattle and sheep respectively ushered in the largescale use of animals for foodfiber and as beasts of burden The shepherd joined the farmer as an essential provider for sedentary and seminomadic societies Maize manioc and arrowroot were first domesticated in America as far back as 5200 BC Farming older than thought University of Calgary 19 February 2007 The potato tomato pepper squash several varieties of bean tobacco and several other plants were also developed in America as was extensive terracing of steep hillsides in much of Andean South America The Greeks and Romans built on techniques pioneered by the Sumerians but made few fundamentally new advances Southern Greeks struggled with very poor soils yet managed to become a dominant society for years The Romans were noted for an emphasis on the cultivation of crops for tradeIn the same region a parallel agricultural revolution occurred resulting in some of the most important crops grown today In Mesoamerica wild teosinte was transformed through human selection into the ancestor of modern maize more than 6000 years ago It gradually spread across North America and was the major crop of Native Americans at the time of European exploration S Johannessen and C A Hastorf eds Corn and Culture in the Prehistoric New World Westview Press Boulder Colorado Other Mesoamerican crops include hundreds of varieties of squash and beans Cocoa was also a major crop domesticated in Mexico and Central America The turkey one of the most important meat birds was probably domesticated in Mexico In the Andes region of South America the major domesticated crop was potatoes domesticated perhaps

the simplest form of the plough was developed called the ard Plough used in the SouthEnglish South Street in 3500 Before this period simple digging sticks or hoes were used These tools would have also been easier to transport which was a benefit as people only stayed until the soils nutrients were depleted However through excavations in Mexico it has been found that the continuous cultivating of smaller pieces of land would also have been a sustaining practice Additional research in central Europe later revealed that agriculture was indeed practiced at this method For this method ards were thus much more efficient than digging sticks The seventy great inventions of the ancient world by Brian MFagan  Middle Ages Agricultural calendar from a manuscript of Pietro de CrescenziThe Middle Ages saw significant improvements in the agricultural techniques and technology There was a steady clearing of woodlands and draining of wetlands for the increase of cropland throughout the period until about the year 1300 Tools such as axes adzes and billhooks were improved but most significant was the gradual evolution of the scratch plough from the classical Mediterranean world into the mouldboard plough capable of turning over the heavy soils of northern Europe The period saw a general move from a two field crop rotation to a three field crop rotation in which one field of three was left fallow every year Also there was a general change from small patchworks of fields to one large open field divided into strips owned by various members of a community The use of watermills was common in the Middle Ages There was tremendous increase in windmills from the 12th to the 13th century some tens of thousands were built Crops were wheat rye barley and oats Peas beans and vetches became common from the 13th century onward as a fodder crop for animals and also for their nitrogenfixation fertilizing properties Crop yields peaked in the 13th century and according to Bruce Campbell and Mark Overton stayed more or less steady until the 18th century Though the limitations of Medieval farming were once thought to have provided a ceiling for the population growth in the Middle Ages recent studies by Campbell and David Stone have shown that the technology of Medieval agriculture was always sufficient for the needs of the people under normal circumstances and that it was only during exceptionally harsh times such as the terrible weather of 131517 that the needs of the population could not be met  Modern developments The Harvesters Pieter Bruegel 1565This photo

breeding that led to its explosive impact over the past 150 years Noel Kingsbury 2009 Hybrid The History and Science of Plant Breeding University of Chicago Press Chicago With the rapid rise of mechanization in the late 19th century and the 20th century particularly in the form of the tractor farming tasks could be done with a speed and on a scale previously impossible These advances have led to efficiencies enabling certain modern farms in the United States Argentina Israel the United Kingdom Germany and a few other nations to output volumes of highquality produce per land unit at what may be the practical limitThe HaberBosch method for synthesizing ammonium nitrate represented a major breakthrough and allowed crop yields to overcome previous constraints In the past century agriculture has been characterized by enhanced productivity the substitution of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labor water pollution and farm subsidies In recent years there has been a backlash against the external environmental effects of conventional agriculture resulting in the organic movementThe cereals rice corn and wheat provide 60 of human food supply Between 1700 and 1980 the total area of cultivated land worldwide increased 466 and yields increased dramatically particularly because of selectively bred highyielding varieties fertilizers pesticides irrigation and machinery Matson et al 1997 Agricultural Intensification and Ecosystem Properties Science For example irrigation increased corn yields in eastern Colorado by 400 to 500 from 1940 to 1997 However concerns have been raised over the sustainability of intensive agriculture Intensive agriculture has become associated with decreased soil quality in India and Asia and there has been increased concern over the effects of fertilizers and pesticides on the environment particularly as population increases and food demand expands The monocultures typically used in intensive agriculture increase the number of pests which are controlled through pesticides Integrated pest management IPM which has been promoted for decades and has had some notable successes has not significantly affected the use of pesticides because policies encourage the use of pesticides and IPM is knowledgeintensive Agricultural exploration expeditions since the late 19th century have been mounted to find new species and

RevolutionNorman Borlaug father of the Green Revolution is often credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation The Green Revolution refers to a series of research development and technology transfer initiatives occurring between the 1940s and the late 1970s that increased agriculture production around the world beginning most markedly in the late 1960s The initiatives led by Norman Borlaug the Father of the Green Revolution credited with saving over a billion people from starvation involved the development of highyielding varieties of cereal grains expansion of irrigation infrastructure modernization of management techniques distribution of hybridized seeds synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to farmersSynthetic nitrogen along with mined rock phosphate pesticides and mechanization have greatly increased crop yields in the early 20th century Increased supply of grains has led to cheaper livestock as well Further global yield increases were experienced later in the 20th century when highyield varieties of common staple grains such as rice wheat and corn maize were introduced as a part of the Green Revolution The Green Revolution exported the technologies including pesticides and synthetic nitrogen of the developed world to the developing world Thomas Malthus famously predicted that the Earth would not be able to support its growing population but technologies such as the Green Revolution have allowed the world to produce a surplus of food Although the Green Revolution significantly increased rice yields in Asia yield increases have not occurred in the past 1520 years The genetic yield potential has increased for wheat but the yield potential for rice has not increased since 1966 and the yield potential for maize has barely increased in 35 years It takes a decade or two for herbicideresistant weeds to emerge and insects become resistant to insecticides within about a decade Crop rotation helps to prevent resistances  Contemporary agriculture Clarks Sector Model 1950 The percent of the human population working in primary sector activities such as agriculture has decreased over timeIn the past century agriculture has been characterized by enhanced productivity the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides selective breeding mechanization water contamination and farm subsidies Proponents of organic farming such as Sir Albert Howard argued in the early 20th century that the overuse of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers damages the longterm fertility of the soil While this feeling lay dormant for decades as environmental awareness has increased in the 21st century there has been a movement towards sustainable agriculture by some farmers consumers and policymakersIn recent years there has been a backlash against perceived external environmental effects of mainstream agriculture particularly regarding water pollution The World Bank 1995 Overcoming Agricultural Water Pollution in the European Union resulting in the organic movement One of the major forces behind this movement has been the European Union which first certified organic food in 1991 and began reform of its Common Agricultural Policy CAP in 2005 to phase out commoditylinked farm subsidies European Commission 2003 CAP Reform also known as decoupling The growth of organic farming has renewed research in alternative technologies such as integrated pest management and selective breeding Recent mainstream technological developments include genetically modified foodIn late 2007 several factors pushed up the price of

agricultural subsidies are often linked to the production of certain commodities such as wheat corn maize rice soybeans and milk The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations FAO leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a neutral forum where nations meet as equals to negotiate agreements and debate food policy and the regulation of agriculture According to Dr Samuel Jutzi director of FAOs animal production and health division lobbying by powerful big food corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment The real true issues are not being addressed by the political process because of the influence of lobbyists of the true powerful entities he said speaking at the Compassion in World Farming annual forum For example recent proposals for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health and environmental regulations such as the number of animals

be taken only as a general guide It represents the most parsimonious way of explaining the three types of endosymbiotic origins of plastids These types include the endosymbiotic events of cyanobacteria red algae and green algae leading to the hypothesis of the supergroups Archaeplastida Chromalveolata and Cabozoa respectively However the monophyly of Cabozoa has been refuted and the monophylies of Archaeplastida and Chromalveolata are currently strongly challenged Endosymbiotic events are noted by dotted linesAlgae  or  singular alga  Latin for seaweed are a very large and diverse group of simple typically autotrophic organisms ranging from unicellular to multicellular forms such as the giant kelps that grow to 65 meters in length Most are photosynthetic like plants and simple because they lack the many distinct cell and organ types found in land plants The largest and most complex marine forms are called seaweedsThough the prokaryotic cyanobacteria are informally referred to as bluegreen algae this usage is incorrect since they are regarded as bacteria Ed Guiry MD John DM Rindi F and McCarthy TK 2007 New Survey of Clare Island Volume 6 The Freshwater and Terrestrial Algae Royal Irish Academy ISBN 9781904890317 The term algae is now restricted to eukaryotic organisms All true algae therefore have a nucleus enclosed within a membrane and plastids bound in one or more membranes Round 1981 Algae constitute a paraphyletic and polyphyletic group as they do not include all the descendants of the last universal ancestor nor do they all descend from a common algal ancestor although their plastids seem to have a single origin Diatoms are also examples of algaeAlgae exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies from simple asexual cell division to complex forms of sexual reproduction Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History Department of Botany httpbotanysieduprojectsalgaeintroductionhtm Algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants such as the leaflike phyllids of bryophytes rhizoids in nonvascular plants and the roots leaves and other organs that are found in tracheophytes vascular plants Many are phototrophic although some groups contain members that are mixotrophic deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by osmotrophy myzotrophy or phagotrophy Some unicellular species rely entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatusNearly all algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from cyanobacteria and so produce oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis unlike other photosynthetic bacteria such as purple and green sulfur bacteria Fossilized filamentous algae from the Vindhya basin have been dated back to 16 to 17 billion years ago Etymology and studyTitle page of Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin Historia Fucorum dated 1768 The singular alga is the Latin word for a particular seaweed and retains that meaning in English The etymology is obscure Although some speculate that it is related to Latin algre be cold there is no known reason to associate seaweed with temperature A more likely source is alliga binding entwining The Ancient Greek word for seaweed was  fkos or phykos which could mean either the seaweed probably red algae or a red dye derived from it The Latinization fcus meant primarily the cosmetic rouge The etymology is uncertain but a strong candidate has long been some word related to the Biblical  pk paint if not that word itself a cosmetic eyeshadow used by the ancient Egyptians and other inhabitants of the eastern Mediterranean It could be any color black red green blue Downloadable Google Books Accordingly the modern study of marine and freshwater algae is called either phycology or algology depending on whether the Greek or Latin root is used The name Fucus appears in a number of taxaClassificationFalsecolor Scanning electron micrograph of the unicellular coccolithophore Gephyrocapsa oceanicaWhile cyanobacteria have been traditionally considered algae recent works usually exclude them due to large differences such as the lack of membranebound organelles the presence of a single circular chromosome the presence of peptidoglycan in the cell walls and ribosomes different in size and content from those of the Eukaryotes Rather than in chloroplasts they conduct photosynthesis on specialized infolded cytoplasmic membranes called thylakoid membranes Therefore they differ significantly from algae despite occupying similar ecological nichesBy modern definitions algae are Eukaryotes and conduct photosynthesis within membranebound organelles called chloroplasts Chloroplasts contain circular DNA and are similar in structure to cyanobacteria presumably representing reduced cyanobacterial endosymbionts The exact nature of the chloroplasts is different among separate lineages of algae reflecting different endosymbiotic events The table below describes the composition of the three major groups of algae Their lineage relationships are shown in the figure in the upper right Many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic Some retain plastids but not chloroplasts while others have lost plastids entirelyPhylogeny based on plastid not nucleocytoplasmic genealogy Supergroup affiliation Members Endosymbiont Summary  PrimoplantaeArchaeplastida  Chlorophyta  Rhodophyta  Glaucophyta Cyanobacteria These algae have primary chloroplasts ie the chloroplasts are surrounded by two membranes and probably developed through a single endosymbiotic event The chloroplasts of red algae have chlorophylls a and c often and phycobilins while those of green algae have chloroplasts with chlorophyll a and b Higher plants are pigmented similarly to green algae and probably developed from them and thus Chlorophyta is a sister taxon to the plants sometimes they are grouped as Viridiplantae  Excavata and Rhizaria  Chlorarachniophytes  Euglenids Green algae These groups have green chloroplasts containing chlorophylls a and b Their chloroplasts are surrounded by four and three membranes respectively and were probably retained from ingested green algae Chlorarachniophytes which belong to the phylum Cercozoa contain a small nucleomorph which is a relict of the algaes nucleus Euglenids which belong to the phylum Euglenozoa live primarily in freshwater and have chloroplasts with only three membranes It has been suggested that the endosymbiotic green algae were acquired through myzocytosis rather than phagocytosis  Chromista and Alveolata  Heterokonts  Haptophyta  Cryptomonads  Dinoflagellates Red algae These groups have chloroplasts containing chlorophylls a and c and phycobilinsThe shape varies

known from any prokaryotes or primary chloroplasts but genetic similarities with red algae suggest a relationship there In the first three of these groups Chromista the chloroplast has four membranes retaining a nucleomorph in Cryptomonads and they likely share a common pigmented ancestor although other evidence casts doubt on whether the Heterokonts Haptophyta and Cryptomonads are in fact more closely related to each other than to other groups The typical dinoflagellate chloroplast has three membranes but there is considerable diversity in chloroplasts within the group and it appears there were a number of endosymbiotic events The Apicomplexa a group of closely related parasites also have plastids called apicoplasts Apicoplasts are not photosynthetic but appear to have a common origin with Dinoflagellate chloroplasts WHHarvey 18111866 was the first to divide algae into four divisions based on their pigmentation This is the first use of a biochemical criterion in plant systematics Harveys four divisions are red algae Rhodophyta brown algae Heteromontophyta green algae Chlorophyta and Diatomaceae Relationship to higher plantsThe first plants on earth probably evolved from shallow freshwater algae much like Chara some 400 million years ago These probably had an isomorphic alternation of generations and were probably filamentous Fossils of isolated land plant spores suggest land plants may have been around as long as 475 million years ago MorphologyThe kelp forest exhibit at the Monterey Bay Aquarium A threedimensional multicellular thallusA range of algal morphologies are exhibited and convergence of features in unrelated groups is common The only groups to exhibit three dimensional multicellular thalli are the reds and browns and some chlorophytes Apical growth is constrained to subsets of these groups the florideophyte reds various browns and the charophytes The form of charophytes is quite different to those of reds and browns because have distinct nodes separated by internode stems whorls of branches reminiscent of the horsetails occur at the nodes Conceptacles are another polyphyletic trait they appear in the coralline algae and the Hildenbrandiales as well as the browns Most of the simpler algae are unicellular flagellates or amoeboids but colonial and nonmotile forms have developed independently among several of the groups Some of the more common organizational levels more than one of which may occur in the life cycle of a species are Colonial small regular groups of motile cells Capsoid individual nonmotile cells embedded in mucilage Coccoid individual nonmotile cells with cell walls Palmelloid nonmotile cells embedded in mucilage Filamentous a string of nonmotile cells connected together sometimes branching Parenchymatous cells forming a thallus with partial differentiation of tissuesCyanobacteria MerismopediaIn three lines even higher levels of organization have been reached with full tissue differentiation These are the brown algae some of which may reach 50 m in length kelps the red algae and the green algae Introduction to the Green Algae The most complex forms are found among the green algae see Charales and Charophyta in a lineage that eventually led to the higher land plants The point where these nonalgal plants begin and algae stop is usually taken to be the presence of reproductive organs with protective cell layers a characteristic not found in the other alga groupsPhysiologyMany algae particularly members of the characeae have served as model experimental organisms to understand the mechanisms of the water permeability of membranes osmoregulation turgor regulation salt tolerance cytoplasmic streaming and the generation of action potentialsSymbiotic algaeSome species of algae form symbiotic relationships with other organisms In these symbioses the algae supply photosynthates organic substances to the host organism providing protection to the algal cells The host organism derives some or all of its energy requirements from the algae Examples are as followsLichensRock lichens in IrelandLichens are defined by the International Association for Lichenology to be an association of a fungus and a photosynthetic symbiont resulting in a stable vegetative body having a specific structure The fungi or mycobionts are from the Ascomycota with a few from the Basidiomycota They are not found alone in nature but when they began to associate is not known One mycobiont associates with the same phycobiont species rarely two from the green algae except that alternatively the mycobiont may associate with the same species of cyanobacteria hence photobiont is the more accurate term A photobiont may be associated with many specific mycobionts or live independently accordingly lichens are named and classified as fungal species Brodo et al 2001 page 6 A species of lichen collected anywhere in its range has the same lichenforming fungus and generally the same photobiont A particular photobiont on the other hand may associate with scores of different lichen fungi The association is termed a morphogenesis because the lichen has a form and capabilities not possessed by the symbiont species alone they can be experimentally isolated It is possible that the photobiont triggers otherwise latent genes in the mycobiont Brodo et al 2001 page 8 Coral reefsFloridian coral reef Coral reefs are accumulated from the calcareous exoskeletons of marine invertebrates of the order Scleractinia stony corals As animals they metabolize sugar and oxygen to obtain energy for their cellbuilding processes including secretion of the exoskeleton with water and carbon dioxide as byproducts As the reef is the result of a favorable equilibrium between construction by the corals and destruction by marine erosion the rate at which metabolism can proceed determines the growth or deterioration of the reefDinoflagellates algal protists are often endosymbionts in the cells of marine invertebrates where they accelerate hostcell metabolism by generating immediately available sugar and oxygen through photosynthesis using incident light and the carbon dioxide produced by the host Stony corals that are reefbuilding corals hermatypic corals require endosymbiotic algae from the genus Symbiodinium to be in a healthy condition The loss of Symbiodinium from the host is known as coral bleaching a condition which leads to the deterioration of a reefSea spongesGreen algae live close to the surface of some sponges for example breadcrumb sponge Halichondria panicea The alga is thus protected from predators the sponge is provided with oxygen and sugars which can account for 50 to 80 of sponge growth in some species httpuwspeducnrUWEXlakeslaketidesvol264vol264pdf LifecycleRhodophyta Chlorophyta and Heterokontophyta the three main algal Phyla have lifecycles which show tremendous variation with considerable complexity In general there is an asexual phase where the seaweeds cells are diploid a sexual phase where the cells are haploid followed by fusion of the male and female gametes Asexual reproduction is advantageous in that it permits efficient population increases but less variation is possible Sexual reproduction allows more variation but is more costly Often there is no strict alternation between the sporophyte and also because there is often an asexual phase which could include the fragmentation of the thallus Lobban C S and Harrison P J 1997 Seaweed Ecology and Physiology Cambridge

number of 72500 algal species worldwide DistributionThe topic of distribution of algal species has been fairly well studied since the founding of phytogeography in the mid19th century AD Round 1981 Chapter 8 Dispersal continuity and phytogeography Algae spread mainly by the dispersal of spores analogously to the dispersal of Plantae by seeds and spores Spores are everywhere in all parts of the Earth the waters fresh and marine the atmosphere freefloating and in precipitation or mixed with dust the humus and in other organisms such as humans Whether a spore is to grow into an organism depends on the combination of the species and the environmental conditions of where the spore landsThe spores of freshwater algae are dispersed mainly by running water and wind as well as by living carriers Round 1981 page 360 The bodies of water into which they are transported are chemically selective Marine spores are spread by currents Ocean water is temperature selective resulting in phytogeographic zones regions and provinces Round 1981 page 362 To some degree the distribution of algae is subject to floristic discontinuities caused by geographical features such as Antarctica long distances of ocean or general land masses It is therefore possible to identify species occurring by locality such as Pacific Algae or North Sea Algae When they occur out of their localities it is usually possible to hypothesize a transport mechanism such as the hulls of ships For example Ulva reticulata and Ulva fasciata travelled from the mainland to Hawaii in this mannerMapping is possible for select species only there are many valid examples of confined distribution patterns Round 1981 Page 357 For example Clathromorphum is an arctic genus and is not mapped far south of there Round 1981 page 371 On the other hand scientists regard the overall data as insufficient due to the difficulties of undertaking such studies Round 1981 page 366 LocationsPhytoplankton Lake ChuzenjiAlgae are prominent in bodies of water common in terrestrial environments and are found in unusual environments such as on snow and on ice Seaweeds grow mostly in shallow marine waters under 100 m however some have been recorded to a depth of 360 m Round 1981 page 176 The various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology Microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column phytoplankton provide the food base for most marine food chains In very high densities algal blooms these algae may discolor the water and outcompete poison or asphyxiate other life formsAlgae are variously

abalone feed Energy sourceTo be competitive and independent from fluctuating support from local policy on the long run biofuels should equal or beat the cost level of fossil fuels Here algae based fuels hold great promise directly related to the potential to produce more biomass per unit area in a year than any other form of biomass The breakeven point for algaebased biofuels is estimated to

incisa is very high in arachidonic acid where it reaches up to 47 of the triglyceride pool Some varieties of algae favored by vegetarianism and veganism contain the longchain essential omega3 fatty acids Docosahexaenoic acid DHA and Eicosapentaenoic acid EPA Fish oil contains the omega3 fatty acids but the original source is algae microalgae in particular which are eaten by marine life such as copepods and are passed up the food chain Algae has emerged in recent years as a popular source of omega3 fatty acids for vegetarians who cannot get longchain EPA and DHA from other vegetarian sources

Scientists developed the ATS which are shallow 100foot raceways of nylon netting where algae colonies can form and studied its efficacy for three years They found that algae can readily be used to reduce the nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and increase the quality of water flowing into rivers streams and oceans The enriched algae itself also can be used as a fertilizer Researchers collected and dried the nutrientrich algae from the ATS and studied its potential as an organic fertilizer They found that cucumber and corn seedlings grew just as well using ATS organic fertilizer as

aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvQWxrYW5l,Chemical structure of methane the simplest alkaneAlkanes  or paraffins a stillused historical name for alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons They consist only of hydrogen and carbon atoms all bonds are single bonds and the carbon atoms are not joined in cyclic structures but instead form a simple chain They have the general chemical formula CnH2n2 Alkanes belong to a homologous series of organic compounds in which the members differ by a molecular mass of 14 one carbon atom of mass 12 and two hydrogen atoms of collective mass 2 There are two main commercial sources crude oil and natural gasEach carbon atom has 4 bonds either CH or CC bonds and each hydrogen atom is joined to a carbon atom HC bonds A series of linked carbon atoms is known as the carbon skeleton or carbon backbone The number of carbon atoms is used to define the size of the alkane eg C2alkaneAn alkyl group generally abbreviated with the symbol R is a functional group or sidechain that like an alkane consists solely of singlebonded carbon and hydrogen atoms for example a methyl or ethyl groupThe simplest possible alkane the parent molecule is methane CH4 There is no limit to the number of carbon atoms that can be linked together the only limitation being that the molecule is acyclic is saturated and is a hydrocarbon Saturated oils and waxes are examples of larger alkanes where the number of carbons in the carbon backbone is greater than 10Alkanes are not very reactive and have little biological activity Alkanes can be viewed as a molecular tree upon which can be hung the more biologically activereactive portions functional groups of the moleculeStructure classificationSaturated hydrocarbons can be linear general formula  wherein the carbon atoms are joined in a snakelike structure branched general formula  n  3 wherein the carbon backbone splits off in one or more directions cyclic general formula  n  2 wherein the carbon backbone is linked so as to form a loopAccording to the definition by IUPAC the former two are alkanes whereas the third group is called cycloalkanes Saturated hydrocarbons can also combine any of the linear cyclic eg polycyclic and branching structures and they are still alkanes no general formula as long as they are acyclic ie having no loopsThey also have single covalent bonds between their carbonsIsomerism Different C4alkanes and cycloalkanes left to right nbutane and isobutane are the two C4H10 isomers cyclobutane and methylcyclopropane are the two C4H8 isomers Bicyclobutane is the only C4H6 compound and has no isomer tetrahedrane not shown is the only C4H4 compound and has also no isomerAlkanes with more than three carbon atoms can be arranged in various different ways forming structural isomers The simplest isomer of an alkane is the one in which the carbon atoms are arranged in a single chain with no branches This isomer is sometimes called the nisomer n for normal although it is not necessarily the most common However the chain of carbon atoms may also be branched at one or more points The number of possible isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms  For example C1 no isomers methane C2 no isomers ethane C3 no isomers propane C4 2 isomers nbutane  isobutane C5 3 isomers pentane isopentane neopentane C6 5 isomers hexane 2Methylpentane 3Methylpentane 23Dimethylbutane  22Dimethylbutane C12 355 isomers C32 27711253769 isomers C60 22158734535770411074184 isomers many of which are not stableBranched alkanes can be chiral For example 3methylhexane and its higher homologues are chiral due to their stereogenic center at carbon atom number 3 In addition to these isomers the chain of carbon atoms may form one or more loops Such compounds are called cycloalkanesNomenclatureThe IUPAC nomenclature systematic way of naming compounds for alkanes is based on identifying hydrocarbon chains Unbranched saturated hydrocarbon chains are named systematically with a Greek numerical prefix denoting the number of carbons and the suffix ane In 1866 August Wilhelm von Hofmann suggested systematizing nomenclature by using the whole sequence of vowels a e i o and u to create suffixes ane ene ine or yne one une for the hydrocarbons CnH2n2 CnH2n CnH2n2 CnH2n4 CnH2n6 Alkane Nomenclature Now the first three name hydrocarbons with single double and triple bonds Thus the ending diene is applied in some cases where von Hofmann had ine one represents a ketone ol represents an alcohol or OH group oxy means an ether and refers to oxygen between two carbons so that methoxymethane is the IUPAC name for dimethyl etherIt is difficult or impossible to find compounds with more than one IUPAC name This is because shorter chains attached to longer chains are prefixes and the convention includes brackets Numbers in the name referring to which carbon a group is attached to should be as low as possible so that 1 is implied and usually omitted from names of organic compounds with only one sidegroup Symmetric compounds will have two ways of arriving at the same nameLinear alkanesStraightchain alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix n for normal where a nonlinear isomer exists Although this is not strictly necessary the usage is still common in cases where there is an important difference in properties between the straightchain and branchedchain isomers eg nhexane or 2 or 3methylpentaneThe members of the series in terms of number of carbon atoms are named as followsmethane CH4  one carbon and four hydrogenethane C2H6  two carbon and six hydrogenpropane C3H8  three carbon and 8 hydrogenbutane C4H10  four carbon and 10 hydrogenpentane C5H12  five carbon and 12 hydrogenhexane C6H14  six carbon and 14 hydrogenThese names were derived from methanol ether propionic acid and butyric acid respectively Alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the suffix ane to the appropriate numerical multiplier prefix with elision of any terminal vowel a or o from the basic numerical term Hence pentane C5H12 hexane C6H14 heptane C7H16 octane C8H18 etc The prefix is generally Greek with the exceptions of nonane which has a Latin prefix and undecane and tridecane which have mixedlanguage prefixes For a more complete list see List of alkanesBranched alkanesBallandstick model of isopentane common name or 2methylbutane IUPAC systematic nameSimple branched alkanes often have a common name using a prefix to distinguish them from linear alkanes for example npentane isopentane and neopentaneIUPAC naming conventions can be used to produce a systematic nameThe key steps in the naming of more complicated branched alkanes are as follows  Identify the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms Name this longest root chain using standard naming rules Name each side chain by changing the suffix of the name of the alkane from ane to yl Number the root chain so that sum of the numbers assigned to each side group will be as low as possible Number and name the side chains before the name of the root chain If there are multiple side chains of the same type use prefixes such as di and tri to indicate it as such and number each one Add side chain names in alphabetical disregarding di etc prefixes order in front of the name of the root chain Comparison of nomenclatures for three isomers of C5H12  Common name npentane isopentane neopentane  IUPAC name pentane 2methylbutane 22dimethylpropane  Structure 120px 90px 70px Cyclic alkanesSocalled cyclic alkanes are in the technical sense not alkanes but cycloalkanes They are hydrocarbons just like alkanes but contain one or more ringsSimple cycloalkanes have a prefix cyclo to distinguish them from alkanes Cycloalkanes are named as per their acyclic counterparts with respect to the number of carbon atoms eg cyclopentane C5H10 is a cycloalkane with 5 carbon atoms just like pentane C5H12 but they are joined up in a fivemembered ring In a similar manner propane and cyclopropane butane and cyclobutane etcSubstituted cycloalkanes are named similar to substituted alkanes  the cycloalkane ring is stated and the substituents are according to their position on the ring with the numbering decided by CahnIngoldPrelog rules Trivial namesThe trivial nonsystematic name for alkanes is paraffins Together alkanes are known as the paraffin series Trivial names for compounds are usually historical artifacts They were coined before the development of systematic names and have been retained due to familiar usage in industry Cycloalkanes are also called naphthenesIt is almost certain that the term paraffin stems from the petrochemical industry Branchedchain alkanes are called isoparaffins The use of the term paraffin is a general term and often does not distinguish between pure compounds and mixtures of isomers ie compounds with the same chemical formula eg pentane and isopentaneExamplesThe following trivial names are retained in the IUPAC system

in CAlkanes experience intermolecular van der Waals forces Stronger intermolecular van der Waals forces give rise to greater boiling points of alkanes There are two determinants for the strength of the van der Waals forces the number of electrons surrounding the molecule which increases with the alkanes molecular weight the surface area of the moleculeUnder standard conditions from CH4 to C4H10 alkanes are gaseous from C5H12 to C17H36 they are liquids and after C18H38 they are solids As the boiling point of alkanes is primarily determined by weight it should not be a surprise that the boiling point has almost a linear relationship with the size molecular weight of the molecule As a rule of thumb the boiling point rises 2030 C for each carbon added to the chain this rule applies to other homologous series A straightchain alkane will have a boiling point higher than a branchedchain alkane due to the greater surface area in contact thus the greater van der Waals forces between adjacent molecules For example compare isobutane 2methylpropane and nbutane butane which boil at 12 and 0 C and 22dimethylbutane and 23dimethylbutane which boil at 50 and 58 C respectively For the latter case two molecules 23dimethylbutane can lock into each other better than the crossshaped 22dimethylbutane hence the greater van der Waals forcesOn the other hand cycloalkanes tend to have higher boiling points than their linear counterparts due to the locked conformations of the molecules which give a plane of intermolecular contactMelting pointThe melting points of the alkanes follow a similar trend to boiling points for the same reason as outlined above That is all other things being equal the larger the molecule the higher the melting point There is one significant difference between boiling points and melting points Solids have more rigid and fixed structure than liquids This rigid structure requires energy to break down Thus the better put together solid structures will require more energy to break apart For alkanes this can be seen from the graph above ie the blue line The oddnumbered alkanes have a lower trend in melting points than even numbered alkanes This is because even numbered alkanes pack well in the solid phase forming a wellorganized structure which requires more energy to break apart The oddnumber alkanes pack less well and so the looser organized solid packing structure requires less energy to break apart The melting points of branchedchain alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straightchain alkanes again depending on the ability of the alkane in question to pack well in the solid phase This is particularly true for isoalkanes 2methyl isomers which often have melting points higher than those of the linear analoguesConductivity and solubilityAlkanes do not conduct electricity nor are they substantially polarized by an electric field For this reason they do not form hydrogen bonds and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water Since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule the coexistence of an alkane and water leads to an increase in molecular order a reduction in entropy As there is no significant bonding between water molecules and alkane molecules the second law of thermodynamics suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimized by minimizing the contact between alkane and water Alkanes are said to be hydrophobic in that they repel waterTheir solubility in nonpolar solvents is relatively good a property that is called lipophilicity Different alkanes are for example miscible in all proportions among themselvesThe density of the alkanes usually increases with increasing number of carbon atoms but remains less than that of water Hence alkanes form the upper layer in an alkanewater mixtureMolecular geometrysp3hybridization in methaneThe molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics It is derived from the electron configuration of carbon which has four valence electrons The carbon atoms in alkanes are always sp3 hybridized that is to say that the valence electrons are said to be in four equivalent orbitals derived from the combination of the 2s orbital and the three 2p orbitals These orbitals which have identical energies are arranged spatially in the form of a tetrahedron the angle of cos1  10947 between themBond lengths and bond anglesAn alkane molecule has only C  H and C  C single bonds The former result from the overlap of a sporbital of carbon with the 1sorbital of a hydrogen the latter by the overlap of two sporbitals on different carbon atoms The bond lengths amount to 1091010 m for a C  H bond and 1541010 m for a C  C bondThe tetrahedral structure of methaneThe spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four sporbitalsthey are tetrahedrally arranged with an angle of 10947 between them Structural formulae that represent the bonds as being at right angles to one another while both common and useful do not correspond with the realityConformationThe structural formula and the bond angles are not usually sufficient to completely describe the geometry of a molecule There is a further degree of freedom for each carbon  carbon bond the torsion angle between the atoms or groups bound to the atoms at each end of the bond The spatial arrangement described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its conformationNewman projections of the two conformations of ethane eclipsed on the left staggered on the rightBallandstick models of the two rotamers of ethaneEthane forms the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes as there is only one C  C bond If one looks down the axis of the C  C bond one will see the socalled Newman projection The hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120 between them resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane However the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0 and 360 This is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon  carbon single bond Despite this apparent freedom only two limiting conformations are important eclipsed conformation and staggered conformationThe two conformations also known as rotamers differ in energy The staggered conformation is 126 kJmol lower in energy more stable than the eclipsed conformation the least stableThis difference in energy between the two conformations known as the torsion energy is low compared to the thermal energy of an ethane molecule at ambient temperature There is constant rotation about the CC bond The time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one staggered conformation to the next equivalent to the rotation of one CH3group by 120 relative to the other is of the order of 1011 secondsThe case of higher alkanes is more complex but based on similar principles with the antiperiplanar conformation always being the most favored around each carboncarbon bond For this reason alkanes are usually shown in a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models The actual structure will always differ somewhat from these idealized forms as the differences in energy between the conformations are small compared to the thermal energy of the molecules Alkane molecules have no fixed structural form whatever the models may suggestSpectroscopic propertiesVirtually all organic compounds contain carbon  carbon and carbon  hydrogen bonds and so show some of the features of alkanes in their spectra Alkanes are notable for having no other groups and therefore for the absence of other characteristic spectroscopic featuresInfrared spectroscopyThe carbonhydrogen stretching mode gives a strong absorption between 2850 and 2960 cm1 while the carboncarbon stretching mode absorbs between 800 and 1300 cm1 The carbonhydrogen bending modes depend on the nature of the group methyl groups show bands at 1450 cm1 and 1375 cm1 while methylene groups show bands at 1465 cm1 and 1450 cm1 Carbon chains with more than four carbon atoms show a weak absorption at around 725 cm1NMR spectroscopyThe proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at H  05  15 The carbon13 resonances depend on the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon C  8  30 primary methyl CH3 15  55 secondary methylene CH2 20  60 tertiary methyne CH and quaternary The carbon13 resonance of quaternary carbon atoms is characteristically weak due to the lack of Nuclear Overhauser effect and the long relaxation time and can be missed in weak samples or samples that have not been run for a sufficiently long timeMass spectrometryAlkanes have a high ionization energy and the molecular ion is usually weak The fragmentation pattern can be difficult to interpret but in the case of branched chain alkanes the carbon chain is preferentially cleaved at tertiary or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting free radicals The fragment resulting from the loss of a single methyl group M15 is often absent and other fragment are often spaced by intervals of fourteen mass units corresponding to sequential loss of CH2groupsChemical propertiesAlkanes are only weakly reactive with ionic and other polar substances The acid dissociation constant pKa values of all alkanes are above 60 hence they are practically inert to acids and bases see carbon acids This inertness is the source of the term paraffins with the meaning here of lacking affinity In crude oil the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of yearsHowever redox reactions of alkanes in particular with oxygen and the halogens are possible as the carbon atoms are in a strongly reduced condition in the case of methane the lowest possible oxidation state for carbon 4 is reached Reaction with oxygen if present in sufficient quantity to satisfy the reaction stoichiometry leads to combustion without any smoke producing carbon dioxide and water Free radical halogenation reactions occur with halogens leading to the production of haloalkanes In addition alkanes have been shown to interact with and bind to certain transition metal complexes in See carbonhydrogen bond activationFree radicals molecules with unpaired electrons play a large role in most reactions of alkanes such as cracking and reformation where longchain alkanes are converted into shorterchain alkanes and straightchain alkanes into branchedchain isomersIn highly branched alkanes the bond angle may differ significantly from the optimal value 1095 in order to allow the different groups sufficient space This causes a tension in the molecule known as steric hindrance and can substantially increase the reactivityReactions with oxygen combustion reactionAll alkanes react with oxygen in a combustion reaction although they become increasingly difficult to ignite as the number of carbon atoms increases The general equation for complete combustion isCnH2n2  15n05O2  n1H2O  nCO2or CnH2n2  3n12O2  n1H2O  nCO2 In the absence of sufficient oxygen carbon monoxide or even soot can be formed as shown belowCnH2n2  n05O2  n1H2O  nCOCnH2n2  05n05O2  n1H2O  nCFor example methane2CH4  3O2  2CO  4H2OCH4  15O2  CO  2H2OSee the alkane heat of formation table for detailed dataThe standard enthalpy change of combustion cHo for alkanes increases by about 650 kJmol per CH2 group Branchedchain alkanes have lower values of cHo than straightchain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms and so can be seen to be somewhat more stableReactions with halogensAlkanes react with halogens in a socalled free radical halogenation reaction The hydrogen atoms of the alkane are progressively replaced by halogen atoms Freeradicals are the reactive species that participate in the reaction which usually leads to a mixture of products The reaction is highly exothermic and can lead to an explosionThese reactions are an important industrial route to halogenated hydrocarbons There are three steps Initiation the halogen radicals form by homolysis Usually energy in the form of heat or light is required Chain reaction or Propagation then takes placethe halogen radical abstracts a hydrogen from the alkane to give an alkyl radical This reacts further Chain termination where step the radicals recombineExperiments have shown that all halogenation produces a mixture of all possible isomers indicating that all hydrogen atoms are susceptible to reaction The mixture produced however is not a statistical mixture Secondary and tertiary hydrogen atoms are preferentially replaced due to the greater stability of secondary and tertiary freeradicals An example can be seen in the monobromination of propane the Figure below the Statistical Distribution should be 25 and 75Monobromination of propaneCrackingCracking breaks larger molecules into smaller ones This can be done with a thermal or catalytic method The thermal cracking process follows a homolytic mechanism with formation of freeradicals The catalytic cracking process involves the presence of acid catalysts usually solid acids such as silicaalumina and zeolites which promote a heterolytic asymmetric breakage of bonds yielding pairs of ions of opposite charges usually a carbocation and the very unstable hydride anion Carbonlocalized freeradicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement CC scission in position beta ie cracking and intra and intermolecular hydrogen transfer or hydride transfer In both types of processes the corresponding reactive intermediates radicals ions are permanently regenerated and thus they proceed by a selfpropagating chain mechanism The chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombinationIsomerization and reformationDragan and his colleague were the first to report about isomerization in alkanes Asinger Friedrich Paraffins Chemistry and Technology Oxford Pergamon Press 1967 Print Isomerization and reformation are processes in which straightchain alkanes are heated in the presence of a platinum catalyst In isomerization the alkanes become branchedchain isomers In other words it does not lose any carbons or hydrogens keeping the same molecular weight In reformation the alkanes become cycloalkanes or aromatic hydrocarbons giving off hydrogen as a byproduct Both of these processes raise the octane number of the substance Butane is the most common alkane that is put under the process of isomerization as it makes many branched alkanes with high octane numbers Other reactionsAlkanes will react with steam in the presence of a nickel catalyst to give hydrogen Alkanes can be chlorosulfonated and nitrated although both reactions require special conditions The fermentation of alkanes to carboxylic acids is of some technical importance In the Reed reaction sulfur dioxide chlorine and light convert hydrocarbons to sulfonyl chlorides Nucleophilic Abstraction can be used to separate an alkane from a metal Alkyl groups can be transferred from one compound to another by transmetalation reactionsOccurrenceOccurrence of alkanes in the UniverseMethane and ethane make up a tiny proportion of Jupiters atmosphereExtraction of oil which contains many different hydrocarbons including alkanesAlkanes form a small portion of the atmospheres of the outer gas planets such as Jupiter 01 methane 00002 ethane

Titans atmosphere periodically rains liquid methane onto the moons surface Titan Arizona in an Icebox Emily Lakdawalla 21 January 2004 verified 28 March 2005 Also on Titan a methanespewing volcano was spotted and this volcanism is believed to be a significant source of the methane in the atmosphere There also appear to be MethaneEthane lakes near the north polar regions of Titan as discovered by Cassinis radar imaging Methane and ethane have also been detected in the tail of the comet Hyakutake Chemical analysis showed that the abundances of ethane and methane were roughly equal which is thought to imply that its ices formed in interstellar space away from the Sun which would have evaporated these volatile molecules Alkanes have also been detected in meteorites such as carbonaceous chondritesOccurrence of alkanes on EarthTraces of methane gas about 00002 or 1745 ppb occur in the Earths atmosphere produced primarily by methanogenic microorganisms such as Archaea in the gut of ruminants The most important commercial sources for alkanes are natural gas and oil Natural gas contains primarily methane and ethane with some propane and butane oil is a mixture of liquid alkanes and other hydrocarbons These hydrocarbons were formed when dead marine animals and plants zooplankton and phytoplankton died and sank to the bottom of ancient seas and were covered with sediments in an anoxic environment and converted over many millions of years at high temperatures and high pressure to their current form Natural gas resulted thereby for example from the following reactionC6H12O6  3CH4  3CO2These hydrocarbon deposits collected in porous rocks trapped beneath impermeable cap rocks comprise commercial oil fields They have formed over millions of years and once exhausted cannot be readily replaced The depletion of these hydrocarbons reserves is the basis for what is known as the energy crisisMethane is also present in what is called biogas produced by animals and decaying matter which is a possible renewable energy sourceAlkanes have a low solubility in water so the content in the oceans is negligible however at high pressures and low temperatures such as at the bottom of the oceans methane can cocrystallize with water to form a solid methane clathrate methane hydrate Although this cannot be commercially exploited at the present time the amount of combustible energy of the known methane clathrate fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together Methane extracted from methane clathrate is therefore a candidate for future fuelsBiological occurrenceAlthough alkanes occur in nature in various way they do not rank biologically among the essential materials Cycloalkanes with 14 to 18 carbon atoms occur in musk extracted from deer of the family Moschidae All further information refers to acyclic alkanesBacteria and archaeaMethanogenic archaea in the gut of this cow are responsible for some of the methane in Earths atmosphereCertain types of bacteria can metabolize alkanes they prefer evennumbered carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than oddnumbered chainsOn the other hand certain archaea the methanogens produce large quantities of methane by the metabolism of carbon dioxide or other oxidized organic compounds The energy is released by the oxidation of hydrogenCO2  4H2  CH4  2H2OMethanogens are also the producers of marsh gas in wetlands and release about two billion tonnes of methane per yearthe atmospheric content of this gas is pr
