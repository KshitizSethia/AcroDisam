United States Air Force Security Forces are the Security Forces Department of the Air Force Police and Air Base Ground Defense ABGD forces of the United States Air Force Security Forces or simply SF were formerly known as Military Police MP Air Police AP and Security Police SPHistoryThe Security Forces career field has a long rich history which predates the inception of the Air Force in 1947 The invention of the aircraft and its subsequent military use required a protective force to guard the aircraft and defend the people who fly and fight In 1921 Italian General Giulio Douhet said It is easier and more effective to destroy the enemys aerial power by destroying his nests and eggs on the ground than to hunt his flying birds in the air Security Forces are and have been that protective force Military Police Army Air Force Military Police colored unit at Columbus Georgia in April 1942In early 1943 the first Army Aviation Military Police Companies were established from existing Army MP units The USAF Security Forces lineage can be traced to its beginning in WWII with the German blitzkrieg Blitzkrieg relied on swift attacks by land and air One of the tactics employed by blitzkrieg was the use of paratroops and airborne forces to capture or destroy in advance air bases A key turning point in air base defensive thinking came with the loss of the island of Crete to German forces and the subsequent capture of the British air base at Maleme in 1941 This single action led then Prime Minister Winston Churchill to study British air base defense policy and in a condemning memo to the Secretary of State for Air and to the Chief of the Air Staff dated June 29 1941 Churchill stated he would no longer tolerate the shortcomings of the Royal Air Force RAF in which half a million RAF personnel had no combat role He ordered that all airmen be armed and ready to fight and die in defense of their air fields and that every airfield should be a stronghold of fighting airground men and not uniformed civilians in the prime of life protected by detachments of soldiers Churchills directive resulted in formation of the RAF RegimentOn February 12 1942 the United States adopted the British air defense philosophy It was then that the Army Chief of Staff General George C Marshall approved the allocation of 53299 AfricanAmericans to the Army Air Forces with the stipulation that air base defense for the number of air bases found necessary be organized and that Negro personnel be used for this purpose as required This order formed the Army Air Forces AAF air base security battalions in June 1942 and was influenced by racial as well as military considerations Units were deployed throughout the European Asian and African theaters and designed to defend against local ground attacks These units were armed with rifles machine guns and 37mm guns Of the initial planned 296 air base security battalions 261 were to be black however the widening Allied superiority of air and ground had reduced this threat and resulted in a diminished need for this goal and by 1943 inactivation of units formed had already begun In 1945 all AAF air base security battalions were closed  Air Police The National Security Act of 1947 established the current United States Department of Defense or DoD and formed the United States Air Force from the Army Air Forces as a separate service MP units serving with the Army Air Corps before this separation were transferred to the Air Force The ArmyAir Force agreement of 1947 stated that each department will be responsible for the security of its own installations However the agreement made no mention of an Air Force ground combat mission Furthermore the Key West Agreement of April 21 1948 identified base defense as one of a number of functions common to all of the military services yet nowhere in the agreement was the assignment of the Air Force to defend its own bases On January 2 1948 General Order No 1 from Headquarters USAF designated those transferred units and personnel as Air Police AP On 1 September 1950 the first Air Police school was established at Tyndall AFB FloridaIn June 1950 the Air Force began urgent operations focused on air base defense with the outbreak of the Korean War A buildup of ground combat forces began The center of this buildup was the expansion of the Air Force Air Police from 10000 in July 1950 to 39000 in December 1951 Still one year into the war the Air Provost Marshal reported that the Air Force is without policy or tactical doctrine for Air Base Ground Defense In haste Air Police serving as the cadre of this force were outfitted with armored vehicles machine guns and recoilless rifles Air base defense was officially implemented by Air Force Regulation AFR 3554 on March 3 1953 AFR 3554 defined air base defense as all measures taken by the installation commander to deny hostile forces access to the area encompassing all buildings equipment facilities landing fields dispersal areas and adjacent terrain However the regulation did not include provisions for sustained ground defense operations Performance of this mission fell to the provisional base defense task forces to be organized and equipped like infantry It was the Strategic Air Commands SAC October 1952 edition of the SAC Manual 2052 which rejected the notion that the USAFs ground defense mission conflicted with Army functions SAC officials felt that success of the Air Force mission might require point defense elements which the Army could not afford to protect much less have the Air Force rely on the Army to come to the rescue Though at times some 32000 to 35000 North Korean guerrillas were operating in United Nations controlled territory they ignored US air bases This would not be the case for USAF Air Bases in the Republic of Vietnam In 1952 the Air Police school was transferred to Parks AFB California and redesignated as the Air Base Defense School to emphasize on air base defense capabilities It soon became evident the emphasis on air base defense was not making much headway On October 13 1956 Air Police training was transferred to Lackland AFB Texas where it evolved into Security Police training and eventually became the US Air Force Security Forces AcademyOn November 1 1964 between 1225 and 1233 AM Vietnamese Communist VC troops attacked Bien Hoa Air Base with six 81mm mortars positioned about 400 meters north outside the air base The VC fired 60 to 80 rounds into parked aircraft and troop billets then withdrew undetected and unabated The attack killed 4 US military personnel wounded 30 destroyed andor damaged 20 B57 bombers US air bases had become targets and became routine targets thereafter The Air Force was not allowed to patrol the perimeter of the their bases That role was left up to the Vietnamese Air Force Also the US Army was cited as being tasked to control the security of the area around the air base and after action scrutiny along with politics served to foster distrust and jealousy between services chains of command and the US and Vietnamese services As a result air bases in South Vietnam were left vulnerable By striking at USAF air bases the North Vietnamese Army NVA and VC employed Giulio Douhets military concept which stated the only effective way to counter air power was to destroy its bases on the ground This concept has also been proven effective during the Indochina War from 19461954 when the Viet Minh regularly attacked French air bases and were successful The NVAVC routinely reconnoitered US air bases for lengthy periods and assessed them for vulnerable points which included terrain reinforcement approach routes reaction time of artillery support and the daily routines of US personnel which included their sleeping and eating times patrol operations and guard shift changes However as good and exact as their reconnaissance was their failure andor inability to chart Security Police patrol patterns became evident in one case when their presence was detected by a USAF Sentry Dog Patrol and a Security Alert Team which lead to their capture During another incident nine Sappers welltrained and highly disciplined combat engineers failed to locate Security Police postings on the flight line The anxious Sappers met their end when they tried to enter the parking ramp by passing directly in front of a SP machinegun emplacement The USAF Sentry Dog program was a product of the Korean War By 1965 the USAF had a pool of sentry dog teams available for deployment to South Vietnam Nightly at every air base sentry dog teams were deployed as a detection and warning screen in the zone separating combat forces from the perimeter Nearly all air base defense personnel agreed that the Sentry Dog Teams rendered outstanding service Some of which went as far as to say Of all the equipment and methods used to detect an attacking enemy force the sentry dog has provided the most sure all inclusive means In response to the threat to air bases the Chief of Staff initiated the Safe Side Program under the Seventh Air Force creating an experimental 226man unit the 1041st USAF Police Squadron Test trained in using the M16 rifle M60 machinegun and air base ground defense tactics After their TDY deployment to Vietnam in the first half of 1967 to field test the concept the Safe Side participants were used as instructors and cadre for future units All were oriented toward US Army Ranger operations much of which did not necessarily directly apply to Air Base Ground Defense ABGD such as longrange reconambush land navigation stream crossing and rappelling Security Police USAF security policemen Far left Amn Marc Joel Berger from Tan Son Nhut Air Base watch for Viet Cong infiltration attempts along the base perimeter during the Vietnam warIn 1966 the name of the career field was changed to Security Police SP and the basic   AFSC from 771XX to 811XX The term was considered descriptive concise and uniformly applicable as it combined two main mission elements Police and Security functionsIn 1968 the Air Force accepted the Safe Side Programs recommendation to establish 559man Combat Security Police Squadrons CSPS organized into three field flights Three CSPS were incrementally activated trained and deployed in 179day TDY rotations to South Vietnam On March 15 1968 the 821st CSPS began a hasty training program at Schofield Barracks Hawaii and was in place at Phan Rang Air Base on its TDY deployment by April 15 The 822nd CSPS was organized more completely trained and replaced the 821st in August 1968 The 823rd CSPS was trained at Ft Campbell Kentucky and replaced the 822nd in March 1969 remaining until August 1969 when it was replaced by the 821st Troop ceilings on forces in South Vietnam did not permit permanent assignment of a CSPS until December 1969 when the withdrawal of US forces was in progress Safe Side was discontinued and the two CONUS units inactivated Reduced to 250 personnel the 821st CSPS remained incountry until February 1971 when it too was inactivated Over time the Air Force Security Police would hone their ground combat skills and tactics based on these initial squadrons and lessons learned in combat In March 1971 the security police career field was split into two separate functions Law Enforcement and Security specialties Law Enforcement personnel provided the typical police response to safeguard personnel and property while Security personnel performed duties associated with physical security the flight line and weapons storage areas The standard issue sidearm for Security Police was the Smith  Wesson Model 15 Combat Masterpiece in caliber 38 Special with a 4inch barrel firing M41 38 ball ammunition Security Forces train for 13 weeksIn 1996 the Khobar Towers Bombing lead to the reassessment of the force protection and Security Police mission and ultimately laid the foundation for the career field transformation into the current Security Forces Security Police members SSgt Alfredo Guerrero SrA Corey Grice and A1C Christopher Wager received the Airmans Medal for their actions prior to and after the terrorist attack Defensegov News Photos wwwdefensegov Retrieved August 14 2011 Secretary of Defense William J Perry stated the Khobar Towers attack should be seen as a watershed event pointing the way to a radically new mindset and dramatic changes in the way we protect our forces Security Forces As threats to the world security changed so did the requirements for security police to better respond to worldwide contingencies and protect Air Force resources Specialized fields with single skills could no longer meet AF needs Consequently Air Force Chief of Staff directed SP staff to reorganize the entire career fieldIn April 1997 three distinct career fields or Air Force Specialties    AFSC merged to become Security Forces SF Security Specialist AFSC 811X0 Law Enforcement Specialist AFSC 811X2 to include Military Working Dog Handler AFSC 811X0A and Combat Arms Training and Maintenance AFSC 753X0 Upon completion of the merge all SF personnel were reassigned AFSCs The current AFSCs are as follows Enlisted 3P0X1 MWDK9 3P0X1A CATM 3P0X1B and Officers 31PXIn 1997 the Air Force activated the 820th Base Defense Group a Force Protection unit based at Moody Air Force Base Georgia The unit is a trained force protection unit of 12  s with an airborne capability At a moments notice the group provides one of expeditionary Air Forces worldwide deployable firstin fully integrated multidisciplinary selfsustaining force protection capability There are few other Security Forces and force protection units in the Air Force with the extensive amount of training diverse deployment history and multiservice validation as the 820th BDG The 435th Security Forces Squadron 435 SFS is a United States Air Force unit capable of overland airlift air assault or airborne insertion into crisis situations The unit incorporates more than 13 different specialties including people with civil engineering medical intelligence investigative fuels logistics personnel and security skills It was formerly known as the 786th Security Forces Squadron 786 SFS In March 2003 the 786 SFS participated in a combat parachute drop into Bashur Airfield in conjunction with the 173rd Airborne Brigade to open up the northern front in Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom The 786 SFS is the first conventional Air Force unit to participate in a combat airborne jump The 786 SFS was redesignated the 435th Security Forces Squadron on 16 July 2009 and falls under the 435th Contingency Response Group CRG formerly 86 CRGThe 1st Special Operations Security Forces Squadron 1 SOSFS part of the 1st Special Operations Wing 1 SOW of the Air Force Special Operations Command exemplifies how some special operations security forces are upgrading their training to protect high risk aircraft and associated air base installations in deployed locations Handpicked members of security forces squadrons from all over Air Force Special Operations Command AFSOC to include Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard units operationallygained by AFSOC as well as special operations units assigned to United States Air Forces in Europe and Pacific Air Forces are participating in a new training program called DAGRE Deployed Aircraft Ground Response Element to upgrade their combat skills to support future AFSOC deployments into contingency areas During this inaugural 11week course security forces Airmen from the 352nd Special Operation Group 352 SOW at RAF Mildenhall the 353rd Special Operation Group at Kadena AB the 27th Special Operations Wing at Cannon AFB the 919th Special Operations Wing at Duke Field Headquarters AFSOC and the collocated 1 SOFS learned advanced combat and shooting tactics and honed unarmed fighting and combat first aid skills All participants received certification from the Air Forces PHOENIX RAVEN program training them to provide security for Air Mobility Commands aircraft in high threat areas In between combat courses and physical training participants are also take classes at the Air Force Special Operations School in antiterrorism counter insurgency and other specialized courses Training culminates with an 8mile tactical road march into a scenario where each team is required to showcase their new skills in an austere environment under hostile conditions Women In The Security Police Field  A Security Forces Marine Patrol airman from MacDill AFB featured in Airman MagazineFemale airmen were first introduced into the Air Forces law enforcement career field in 1971 An all male career field since its inception the Security Police did not accept this innovation easily How ever since women had been serving in civilian police forces for several years these women were quickly integrated into the field As more women were trained and as they proved themselves capable of wider application in the career field it became apparent that they had interests well beyond law enforcement The first women dog handlers came into service in 1973 and the first women entered the corrections field in 1974 While the first introduction of women into the career field was not until 1971 the gender barrier had been broken earlier by Renee Rubin Renee a San Francisco lawyer and a reservist was assigned as a mobilization day assignee to the Air Police headquarters staff in 1962 During her career as a reservist she achieved the rank of colonel and served as the IMA to the office of the Deputy Chief of Security Police It was 1973 before the first female commissioned officer Lt Sally Kucera was graduated from the Basic Security Police Officers Course The career of Sally now Col Sally D Uebelacker has been a model for any young woman to follow as she rose from 2nd lieutenant to the rank of colonel By 1976 the number of women in the career field had risen from 198 to 1280 or to almost 4 of the force Clearly a dichotomy existed where the Security Police officer was concerned The split career field affected only the enlisted force Officers might serve in any capacity including commanding combat troops in a war zone In 1976 Lt Pamela Kraus became the first woman to graduate from the Air Base Defense Course at Camp Bullis Texas The same year 1976 100 women were selected to participate in a one year test of women serving in the security career field Twenty five were assigned to each of four security units The test was to determine whether or not women could perform the wide variety of security and ground defense tasks incumbent upon the career field To most of the senior leadership of the career field the answer to the question was known before the test began Certainly women could perform the duties During the test period they proved their capabilities Even at that the test was a qualified success The real question which was yet to be answered was whether or not as a matter of national policy were we ready to place women in harms way in combat The answer to that question was still several years away but ultimately the career field was open to women without limitations One of the issues addressed in bringing women into the field was the question of functionality vs femininityBrig General Jeane Holm the officer with primary oversight of womens matters in the Directorate of Personnel was opposed to arming the women with standard issue weapons carried in holsters on the side Initially they were armed with the 2 inch barrel 38 and it was to be carried in the purseDuring one staff visit a young lady complained bitterly Hell Colonel I cant even find my lipstick in my purse What will I do if I need my gun Ultimately the women were armed the same as were the menIn 1984 the full integration of the security police force was achieved when the Secretary of the Air Force approved a revised combat exclusion policy affecting Security Police women This revision opened previously closed security specialties in combat zones to womenIn January 1985 the first female student attended the Security Specialist Course under the permanent program and on May 1st 1985 twelve active duty women made up the first all female flight in the Security Specialist CourseCulture General Orders Security Forces members are required to know and adhere to three general orders which form the foundation of their duties These orders apply to every assigned post or patrol they will ever assume The general orders are as follows I will take charge of my post and protect all personnel and property for which I am responsible for until properly relieved I will report all violations of the orders I am entrusted to enforce and call my superiors in any case not covered by instructions I will sound the alarm in any case of disorder or emergency Security Forces Motto The motto of Security Forces is the Latin phrase Defensor Fortis The United States Air Force maintains the SF motto means The literal meaning of the motto translates to Strong Defender httptranslategooglecomhlentabwTenlacourageous  Security Forces Creed Before the Airmans Creed replaced all other AF creeds the career field had the Security Forces Creed a promise to the United States the Air Force individual SF members and all those who came before It is a promise to honor the past protect the present and secure the future It is a promise to be ready to act and to live the ideals that will guide the actions of SF members I am a security force member I hold allegiance to my country devotion to duty and personal integrity above all I wear my shield of authority with dignity and restraint and promote by example high standards of conduct appearance courtesy and performance I seek no favor because of my position I perform my duties in a firm courteous and impartial manner irrespective of a persons color race religion national origin or sex I strive to merit the respect of my fellow airmen and all with whom I come in contact Security Forces Prayer In 1980 Colonel Jerry Bullock an ordained minister wrote the official Security Forces prayer while serving with Brig Gen WIlliam R Brooksher as the deputy commander of the Air Force Office of Security Police The prayer is recited as followsLord you have called us to be guardians of a nation founded on Your principles Whatever our tasks as Security Force men and women we do them to serve You and our nation We are proud to accept the responsibility of this high calling We dedicate ourselves to our vocation and ask for guidance and courage in aiding our people to live with dignity in safety and peace We know true security comes from your presence so we pray with the Psalmist You bless those who obey You Lord Your love protects them like a shield Use us O Lord as shields for Your people reflecting Your security and peace United States Air Force Base Honor Guard United States Air Force Base Honor Guard origins can be traced to May 1948 when Headquarters Command United States Air Force directed the creation of an elite ceremonial unit comparable to that of the other services A ceremonial unit was activated within the 1100th Air Police Squadron at Bolling AFB Washington DC with the responsibility of maintaining an Air Force ceremonial capability in the National Capital Region 24 years later USAF HG officially became a separate squadron in 1972 and has remained at Bolling AFB to this dayUnique Uniform ItemsSecurity Forces ShieldIn 1959 General Curtis E LeMay the USAF Vice Chief of Staff issued the first official AP shield to Brig General R F Burnham the Air Provost Marshal The shield actually started out as a Military PoliceAir Police Brassard but repeated requests tThe current shield was adopted in 1966 the birth year of the Security Police It consists of a threeelement design derived from the Great Seal of the USAF surmounting a circular body representative of a warriors battle shield symbolic of the protection Security Forces provide to Air Force personnel and assetsIndividual elements of the design symbolize Air Force strengths and traditions The American bald eagle taken from the crest on the Great Seal is the symbol of the United States and air striking power The cloud formation depicts the creation of a new firmament and the wreath on which the eagle is perched composed of six alternate twists of silver and blue incorporates the colors of the basic shield design The coat of arms shield of the Great Seal divided by the nebuly line formation representing clouds is charged with the heraldic thunderbolt The thunderbolt portrays striking power through the medium of air Blue Beret A member of the USAF Security Forces

of the SAC Elite Guard in 1957 complete with a photo of the ceremony clearly showing the Elite Guardsmen in their signature blue wool berets and bonehandled 38 revolvers In 196667 during Operation Safe Side the first Security Police beret was issued by the 1041st Security Police Squadron This experimental and specially trained Air Base Ground Defense ABGD unit adopted a light blue beret displaying a falcon as its emblem Operation Safe Side developed into the 82nd Combat Security Police Wing consisting of three combat security police squadrons but was inactivated in December 1968 ending the unofficial use of the light blue beret Elsewhere during the Vietnam War although not an authorized uniform item some local security police commanders approved a dark blue beret similar to the SAC Elite Guard beret for their units as a lessconspicuous alternative to the official white Security Police cover for certain specialized personnel In Thailand during the late 1960s and early 1970s Military Working Dog handlers assigned to the 6280th SPS at the Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base sported a dark blue beret with no insignia Other units adopted a beret to distinguish their guards In 1975 Brigadier General Thomas Sadler was appointed Air Force Chief of Security Police with the task of bringing the Security Police career field into the mainstream of the Air Force One tool he employed was recognition of members of a distinctive portion of the force with the beret proposed as a uniform change Significant opposition to the beret from senior colonels and Major Command MAJCOM Chiefs was gradually overcome by the popularity of the concept with personnel The uniform board approved the proposal and the beret was officially worn worldwide starting in February 1976 The 1976 beret was worn with the MAJCOM crest of the appropriate major command to which the unit was assigned It continued in this manner for 20 years until the forming of the Security Forces In March 1997 the 82nd CSPW was reactivated and redesignated the 820th Security Forces Group The heraldry of the 820th SFG then replaced the individual MAJCOM emblems as beret insignia Enlisted personnel wear

United States Air Force Security Forces are the Security Forces Department of the Air Force Police and Air Base Ground Defense ABGD forces of the United States Air Force Security Forces or simply SF were formerly known as Military Police MP Air Police AP and Security Police SPHistoryThe Security Forces career field has a long rich history which predates the inception of the Air Force in 1947 The invention of the aircraft and its subsequent military use required a protective force to guard the aircraft and defend the people who fly and fight In 1921 Italian General Giulio Douhet said It is easier and more effective to destroy the enemys aerial power by destroying his nests and eggs on the ground than to hunt his flying birds in the air Security Forces are and have been that protective force Military Police Army Air Force Military Police colored unit at Columbus Georgia in April 1942In early 1943 the first Army Aviation Military Police Companies were established from existing Army MP units The USAF Security Forces lineage can be traced to its beginning in WWII with the German blitzkrieg Blitzkrieg relied on swift attacks by land and air One of the tactics employed by blitzkrieg was the use of paratroops and airborne forces to capture or destroy in advance air bases A key turning point in air base defensive thinking came with the loss of the island of Crete to German forces and the subsequent capture of the British air base at Maleme in 1941 This single action led then Prime Minister Winston Churchill to study British air base defense policy and in a condemning memo to the Secretary of State for Air and to the Chief of the Air Staff dated June 29 1941 Churchill stated he would no longer tolerate the shortcomings of the Royal Air Force RAF in which half a million RAF personnel had no combat role He ordered that all airmen be armed and ready to fight and die in defense of their air fields and that every airfield should be a stronghold of fighting airground men and not uniformed civilians in the prime of life protected by detachments of soldiers Churchills directive resulted in formation of the RAF RegimentOn February 12 1942 the United States adopted the British air defense philosophy It was then that the Army Chief of Staff General George C Marshall approved the allocation of 53299 AfricanAmericans to the Army Air Forces with the stipulation that air base defense for the number of air bases found necessary be organized and that Negro personnel be used for this purpose as required This order formed the Army Air Forces AAF air base security battalions in June 1942 and was influenced by racial as well as military considerations Units were deployed throughout the European Asian and African theaters and designed to defend against local ground attacks These units were armed with rifles machine guns and 37mm guns Of the initial planned 296 air base security battalions 261 were to be black however the widening Allied superiority of air and ground had reduced this threat and resulted in a diminished need for this goal and by 1943 inactivation of units formed had already begun In 1945 all AAF air base security battalions were closed  Air Police The National Security Act of 1947 established the current United States Department of Defense or DoD and formed the United States Air Force from the Army Air Forces as a separate service MP units serving with the Army Air Corps before this separation were transferred to the Air Force The ArmyAir Force agreement of 1947 stated that each department will be responsible for the security of its own installations However the agreement made no mention of an Air Force ground combat mission Furthermore the Key West Agreement of April 21 1948 identified base defense as one of a number of functions common to all of the military services yet nowhere in the agreement was the assignment of the Air Force to defend its own bases On January 2 1948 General Order No 1 from Headquarters USAF designated those transferred units and personnel as Air Police AP On 1 September 1950 the first Air Police school was established at Tyndall AFB FloridaIn June 1950 the Air Force began urgent operations focused on air base defense with the outbreak of the Korean War A buildup of ground combat forces began The center of this buildup was the expansion of the Air Force Air Police from 10000 in July 1950 to 39000 in December 1951 Still one year into the war the Air Provost Marshal reported that the Air Force is without policy or tactical doctrine for Air Base Ground Defense In haste Air Police serving as the cadre of this force were outfitted with armored vehicles machine guns and recoilless rifles Air base defense was officially implemented by Air Force Regulation AFR 3554 on March 3 1953 AFR 3554 defined air base defense as all measures taken by the installation commander to deny hostile forces access to the area encompassing all buildings equipment facilities landing fields dispersal areas and adjacent terrain However the regulation did not include provisions for sustained ground defense operations Performance of this mission fell to the provisional base defense task forces to be organized and equipped like infantry It was the Strategic Air Commands SAC October 1952 edition of the SAC Manual 2052 which rejected the notion that the USAFs ground defense mission conflicted with Army functions SAC officials felt that success of the Air Force mission might require point defense elements which the Army could not afford to protect much less have the Air Force rely on the Army to come to the rescue Though at times some 32000 to 35000 North Korean guerrillas were operating in United Nations controlled territory they ignored US air bases This would not be the case for USAF Air Bases in the Republic of Vietnam In 1952 the Air Police school was transferred to Parks AFB California and redesignated as the Air Base Defense School to emphasize on air base defense capabilities It soon became evident the emphasis on air base defense was not making much headway On October 13 1956 Air Police training was transferred to Lackland AFB Texas where it evolved into Security Police training and eventually became the US Air Force Security Forces AcademyOn November 1 1964 between 1225 and 1233 AM Vietnamese Communist VC troops attacked Bien Hoa Air Base with six 81mm mortars positioned about 400 meters north outside the air base The VC fired 60 to 80 rounds into parked aircraft and troop billets then withdrew undetected and unabated The attack killed 4 US military personnel wounded 30 destroyed andor damaged 20 B57 bombers US air bases had become targets and became routine targets thereafter The Air Force was not allowed to patrol the perimeter of the their bases That role was left up to the Vietnamese Air Force Also the US Army was cited as being tasked to control the security of the area around the air base and after action scrutiny along with politics served to foster distrust and jealousy between services chains of command and the US and Vietnamese services As a result air bases in South Vietnam were left vulnerable By striking at USAF air bases the North Vietnamese Army NVA and VC employed Giulio Douhets military concept which stated the only effective way to counter air power was to destroy its bases on the ground This concept has also been proven effective during the Indochina War from 19461954 when the Viet Minh regularly attacked French air bases and were successful The NVAVC routinely reconnoitered US air bases for lengthy periods and assessed them for vulnerable points which included terrain reinforcement approach routes reaction time of artillery support and the daily routines of US personnel which included their sleeping and eating times patrol operations and guard shift changes However as good and exact as their reconnaissance was their failure andor inability to chart Security Police patrol patterns became evident in one case when their presence was detected by a USAF Sentry Dog Patrol and a Security Alert Team which lead to their capture During another incident nine Sappers welltrained and highly disciplined combat engineers failed to locate Security Police postings on the flight line The anxious Sappers met their end when they tried to enter the parking ramp by passing directly in front of a SP machinegun emplacement The USAF Sentry Dog program was a product of the Korean War By 1965 the USAF had a pool of sentry dog teams available for deployment to South Vietnam Nightly at every air base sentry dog teams were deployed as a detection and warning screen in the zone separating combat forces from the perimeter Nearly all air base defense personnel agreed that the Sentry Dog Teams rendered outstanding service Some of which went as far as to say Of all the equipment and methods used to detect an attacking enemy force the sentry dog has provided the most sure all inclusive means In response to the threat to air bases the Chief of Staff initiated the Safe Side Program under the Seventh Air Force creating an experimental 226man unit the 1041st USAF Police Squadron Test trained in using the M16 rifle M60 machinegun and air base ground defense tactics After their TDY deployment to Vietnam in the first half of 1967 to field test the concept the Safe Side participants were used as instructors and cadre for future units All were oriented toward US Army Ranger operations much of which did not necessarily directly apply to Air Base Ground Defense ABGD such as longrange reconambush land navigation stream crossing and rappelling Security Police USAF security policemen Far left Amn Marc Joel Berger from Tan Son Nhut Air Base watch for Viet Cong infiltration attempts along the base perimeter during the Vietnam warIn 1966 the name of the career field was changed to Security Police SP and the basic   AFSC from 771XX to 811XX The term was considered descriptive concise and uniformly applicable as it combined two main mission elements Police and Security functionsIn 1968 the Air Force accepted the Safe Side Programs recommendation to establish 559man Combat Security Police Squadrons CSPS organized into three field flights Three CSPS were incrementally activated trained and deployed in 179day TDY rotations to South Vietnam On March 15 1968 the 821st CSPS began a hasty training program at Schofield Barracks Hawaii and was in place at Phan Rang Air Base on its TDY deployment by April 15 The 822nd CSPS was organized more completely trained and replaced the 821st in August 1968 The 823rd CSPS was trained at Ft Campbell Kentucky and replaced the 822nd in March 1969 remaining until August 1969 when it was replaced by the 821st Troop ceilings on forces in South Vietnam did not permit permanent assignment of a CSPS until December 1969 when the withdrawal of US forces was in progress Safe Side was discontinued and the two CONUS units inactivated Reduced to 250 personnel the 821st CSPS remained incountry until February 1971 when it too was inactivated Over time the Air Force Security Police would hone their ground combat skills and tactics based on these initial squadrons and lessons learned in combat In March 1971 the security police career field was split into two separate functions Law Enforcement and Security specialties Law Enforcement personnel provided the typical police response to safeguard personnel and property while Security personnel performed duties associated with physical security the flight line and weapons storage areas The standard issue sidearm for Security Police was the Smith  Wesson Model 15 Combat Masterpiece in caliber 38 Special with a 4inch barrel firing M41 38 ball ammunition Security Forces train for 13 weeksIn 1996 the Khobar Towers Bombing lead to the reassessment of the force protection and Security Police mission and ultimately laid the foundation for the career field transformation into the current Security Forces Security Police members SSgt Alfredo Guerrero SrA Corey Grice and A1C Christopher Wager received the Airmans Medal for their actions prior to and after the terrorist attack Defensegov News Photos wwwdefensegov Retrieved August 14 2011 Secretary of Defense William J Perry stated the Khobar Towers attack should be seen as a watershed event pointing the way to a radically new mindset and dramatic changes in the way we protect our forces Security Forces As threats to the world security changed so did the requirements for security police to better respond to worldwide contingencies and protect Air Force resources Specialized fields with single skills could no longer meet AF needs Consequently Air Force Chief of Staff directed SP staff to reorganize the entire career fieldIn April 1997 three distinct career fields or Air Force Specialties    AFSC merged to become Security Forces SF Security Specialist AFSC 811X0 Law Enforcement Specialist AFSC 811X2 to include Military Working Dog Handler AFSC 811X0A and Combat Arms Training and Maintenance AFSC 753X0 Upon completion of the merge all SF personnel were reassigned AFSCs The current AFSCs are as follows Enlisted 3P0X1 MWDK9 3P0X1A CATM 3P0X1B and Officers 31PXIn 1997 the Air Force activated the 820th Base Defense Group a Force Protection unit based at Moody Air Force Base Georgia The unit is a trained force protection unit of 12  s with an airborne capability At a moments notice the group provides one of expeditionary Air Forces worldwide deployable firstin fully integrated multidisciplinary selfsustaining force protection capability There are few other Security Forces and force protection units in the Air Force with the extensive amount of training diverse deployment history and multiservice validation as the 820th BDG The 435th Security Forces Squadron 435 SFS is a United States Air Force unit capable of overland airlift air assault or airborne insertion into crisis situations The unit incorporates more than 13 different specialties including people with civil engineering medical intelligence investigative fuels logistics personnel and security skills It was formerly known as the 786th Security Forces Squadron 786 SFS In March 2003 the 786 SFS participated in a combat parachute drop into Bashur Airfield in conjunction with the 173rd Airborne Brigade to open up the northern front in Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom The 786 SFS is the first conventional Air Force unit to participate in a combat airborne jump The 786 SFS was redesignated the 435th Security Forces Squadron on 16 July 2009 and falls under the 435th Contingency Response Group CRG formerly 86 CRGThe 1st Special Operations Security Forces Squadron 1 SOSFS part of the 1st Special Operations Wing 1 SOW of the Air Force Special Operations Command exemplifies how some special operations security forces are upgrading their training to protect high risk aircraft and

and Air National Guard units operationallygained by AFSOC as well as special operations units assigned to United States Air Forces in Europe and Pacific Air Forces are participating in a new training program called DAGRE Deployed Aircraft Ground Response Element to upgrade their combat skills to support future AFSOC deployments into contingency areas During this inaugural 11week course security

Operations Wing at Duke Field Headquarters AFSOC and the collocated 1 SOFS learned advanced combat and shooting tactics and honed unarmed fighting and combat first aid skills All participants received certification from the Air Forces PHOENIX RAVEN program training them to provide security for Air Mobility Commands aircraft in high threat areas In between combat courses and physical training participants are also take classes at the Air Force Special Operations School in antiterrorism counter insurgency and other specialized courses Training culminates with an 8mile tactical road march into a scenario where each team is required to showcase their new skills in an austere environment under hostile conditions Women In The Security Police Field  A Security Forces Marine Patrol airman from MacDill AFB featured in Airman MagazineFemale airmen were first introduced into the Air Forces law enforcement career field in 1971 An all male career field since its inception the Security Police did not accept this innovation easily How ever since women had been serving in civilian police forces for several years these women were quickly integrated into the field As more women were trained and as they proved themselves capable of wider application in the career field it became apparent that they had interests well beyond law enforcement The first women dog handlers came into service in 1973 and the first women entered the corrections field in 1974 While the first introduction of women into the career field was not until 1971 the gender barrier had been broken earlier by Renee Rubin Renee a San Francisco lawyer and a reservist was assigned as a mobilization day assignee to the Air Police headquarters staff in 1962 During her career as a reservist she achieved the rank of colonel and served as the IMA to the office of the Deputy Chief of Security Police It was 1973 before the first female commissioned officer Lt Sally Kucera was graduated from the Basic Security Police Officers Course The career of Sally now Col Sally D Uebelacker has been a model for any young woman to follow as she rose from 2nd lieutenant to the rank of colonel By 1976 the number of women in the career field had risen from 198 to 1280 or to almost 4 of the force Clearly a dichotomy existed where the Security Police officer was concerned The split career field affected only the enlisted force Officers might serve in any capacity including commanding combat troops in a war zone In 1976 Lt Pamela Kraus became the first woman to graduate from the Air Base Defense Course at Camp Bullis Texas The same year 1976 100 women were selected to participate in a one year test of women serving in the security career field Twenty five were assigned to each of four security units The test was to determine whether or not women could perform the wide variety of security and ground defense tasks incumbent upon the career field To most of the senior leadership of the career field the answer to the question was known before the test began Certainly women could perform the duties During the test period they proved their capabilities Even at that the test was a qualified success The real question which was yet to be answered was whether or not as a matter of national policy were we ready to place women in harms way in combat The answer to that question was still several years away but ultimately the career field was open to women without limitations One of the issues addressed in bringing women into the field was the question of functionality vs femininityBrig General Jeane Holm the officer with primary oversight of womens matters in the Directorate of Personnel was opposed to arming the women with standard issue weapons carried in holsters on the side Initially they were armed with the 2 inch barrel 38 and it was to be carried in the purseDuring one staff visit a young lady complained bitterly Hell Colonel I cant even find my lipstick in my purse What will I do if I need my gun Ultimately the women were armed the same as were the menIn 1984 the full integration of the security police force was achieved when the Secretary of the Air Force approved a revised combat exclusion policy affecting Security Police women This revision opened previously closed security specialties in combat zones to womenIn January 1985 the first female student attended the Security Specialist Course under the permanent program and on May 1st 1985 twelve active duty women made up the first all female flight in the Security Specialist CourseCulture General Orders Security Forces members are required to know and adhere to three general orders which form the foundation of their duties These orders apply to every assigned post or patrol they will ever assume The general orders are as follows I will take charge of my post and protect all personnel and property for which I am responsible for until properly relieved I will report all violations of the orders I am entrusted to enforce and call my superiors in any case not covered by instructions I will sound the alarm in any case of disorder or emergency Security Forces Motto The motto of Security Forces is the Latin phrase Defensor Fortis The United States Air Force maintains the SF motto means The literal meaning of the motto translates to Strong Defender httptranslategooglecomhlentabwTenlacourageous  Security Forces Creed Before the Airmans Creed replaced all other AF creeds the career field had the Security Forces Creed a promise to the United States the Air Force individual SF members and all those who came before It is a promise to honor the past protect the present and secure the future It is a promise to be ready to act and to live the ideals that will guide the actions of SF members I am a security force member I hold allegiance to my country devotion to duty and personal integrity above all I wear my shield of authority with dignity and restraint and promote by example high standards of conduct appearance courtesy and performance I seek no favor because of my position I perform my duties in a firm courteous and impartial manner irrespective of a persons color race religion national origin or sex I strive to merit the respect of my fellow airmen and all with whom I come in contact Security Forces Prayer In 1980 Colonel Jerry Bullock an ordained minister wrote the official Security Forces prayer while serving with Brig Gen WIlliam R Brooksher as the deputy commander of the Air Force Office of Security Police The prayer is recited as followsLord you have called us to be guardians of a nation founded on Your principles Whatever our tasks as Security Force men and women we do them to serve You and our nation We are proud to accept the responsibility of this high calling We dedicate ourselves to our vocation and ask for guidance and courage in aiding our people to live with dignity in safety and peace We know true security comes from your presence so we pray with the Psalmist You bless those who obey You Lord Your love protects them like a shield Use us O Lord as shields for Your people reflecting Your security and peace United States Air Force Base Honor Guard United States Air Force Base Honor Guard origins can be traced to May 1948 when Headquarters Command United States Air Force directed the creation of an elite ceremonial unit comparable to that of the other services A ceremonial unit was activated within the 1100th Air Police Squadron at Bolling AFB Washington DC with the responsibility of maintaining an Air Force ceremonial capability in the National Capital Region 24 years later USAF HG officially became a separate squadron in 1972 and has remained at Bolling AFB to this dayUnique Uniform ItemsSecurity Forces ShieldIn 1959 General Curtis E LeMay the USAF Vice Chief of Staff issued the first official AP shield to Brig General R F Burnham the Air Provost Marshal The shield actually started out as a Military PoliceAir Police Brassard but repeated requests tThe current shield was adopted in 1966 the birth year of the Security Police It consists of a threeelement design derived from the Great Seal of the USAF surmounting a circular body representative of a warriors battle shield symbolic of the protection Security Forces provide to Air Force personnel and assetsIndividual elements of the design symbolize Air Force strengths and traditions The American bald eagle taken from the crest on the Great Seal is the symbol of the United States and air striking power The cloud formation depicts the creation of a new firmament and the wreath on which the eagle is perched composed of six alternate twists of silver and blue incorporates the colors of the basic shield design The coat of arms shield of the Great Seal divided by the nebuly line formation representing clouds is charged with the heraldic thunderbolt The thunderbolt portrays striking power through the medium of air Blue Beret A member of the USAF Security Forces

of the SAC Elite Guard in 1957 complete with a photo of the ceremony clearly showing the Elite Guardsmen in their signature blue wool berets and bonehandled 38 revolvers In 196667 during Operation Safe Side the first Security Police beret was issued by the 1041st Security Police Squadron This experimental and specially trained Air Base Ground Defense ABGD unit adopted a light blue beret displaying a falcon as its emblem Operation Safe Side developed into the 82nd Combat Security Police Wing consisting of three combat security police squadrons but was inactivated in December 1968 ending the unofficial use of the light blue beret Elsewhere during the Vietnam War although not an authorized uniform item some local security police commanders approved a dark blue beret similar to the SAC Elite Guard beret for their units as a lessconspicuous alternative to the official white Security Police cover for certain specialized personnel In Thailand during the late 1960s and early 1970s Military Working Dog handlers assigned to the 6280th SPS at the Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base sported a dark blue beret with no insignia Other units adopted a beret to distinguish their guards In 1975 Brigadier General Thomas Sadler was appointed Air Force Chief of Security Police with the task of bringing the Security Police career field into the mainstream of the Air Force One tool he employed was recognition of members of a distinctive portion of the force with the beret proposed as a uniform change Significant opposition to the beret from senior colonels and Major Command MAJCOM Chiefs was gradually overcome by the popularity of the concept with personnel The uniform board approved the proposal and the beret was officially worn worldwide starting in February 1976 The 1976 beret was worn with the MAJCOM crest of the appropriate major command to which the unit was assigned It continued in this manner for 20 years until the forming of the Security Forces In March 1997 the 82nd CSPW was reactivated and redesignated the 820th Security Forces Group The heraldry of the 820th SFG then replaced the individual MAJCOM emblems as beret insignia Enlisted personnel wear

The Fraunhofer Society   Fraunhofer Society for the advancement of applied research  is a German research organization with 60 institutes spread throughout Germany each focusing on different fields of applied science as opposed to the Max Planck Society which works primarily on basic science It employs around 20000 people mainly scientists and engineers with an annual research budget of about 165 billion Some basic funding for the Fraunhofer Society is provided by the state the German public through federal government together with the German Lnder owns the Fraunhofer Society but more than 70 of the funding is earned through contract work either for government sponsored projects or from industryIt is named after Joseph von Fraunhofer who as a scientist an engineer and an entrepreneur is said to have superbly exemplified the goals of the societyThe organization has seven centers in the United States under the name Fraunhofer USA and three in Asia In October 2010 Fraunhofer announced that it would open its first research center in South America  The Fraunhofer Model The socalled Fraunhofer Model has been in existence since 1973 and has led to the societys continuing growth Under the model the Fraunhofer Society earns about 70 of its income through contracts with industry or specific government projects The other 30 of the budget is sourced in the proportion 91 from federal and state Land government grants and is used to support preparatory researchThus the size of the societys budget depends largely on its success in maximizing revenue from commissions This funding model applies not just to the central society itself but also to the individual institutes This serves both to drive the realisation of the Fraunhofer Societys strategic direction of becoming a leader in applied research as well as encouraging a flexible autonomous and entrepreneurial approach to the societys research prioritiesInstitutesThe Fraunhofer Society currently operates 60 institutes These

Text:
In telecommunication a line code also called digital baseband modulation also called digital baseband transmission method is a code chosen for use within a communications system for baseband transmission purposes Line coding is often used for digital data transport Line coding Line coding consists of representing the digital signal to be transported by an amplitude and timediscrete signal that is optimally tuned for the specific properties of the physical channel and of the receiving equipment The waveform pattern of voltage or current used to represent the 1s and 0s of a digital data on a transmission link is called line encoding The common types of line encoding are unipolar polar bipolar and Manchester encodingFor reliable clock recovery at the receiver one usually imposes a maximum run length constraint on the generated channel sequence ie the maximum number of consecutive ones or zeros is bounded to a reasonable number A clock period is recovered by observing transitions in the received sequence so that a maximum run length guarantees such clock recovery while sequences without such a constraint could seriously hamper the detection qualityAfter line coding the signal is put through a physical channel either a transmission medium or data storage medium Sometimes the characteristics of two very differentseeming channels are similar enough that the same line code is used for them The most common physical channels are the linecoded signal can directly be put on a transmission line in the form of variations of the voltage or current often using differential signaling the linecoded signal the baseband signal undergoes further pulse shaping to reduce its frequency bandwidth and then modulated to shift its frequency to create an RF signal that can be sent through free space the linecoded signal can be used to turn on and off a light source in freespace optical communication most commonly used in an infrared remote control the linecoded signal can be printed on paper to create a bar code the linecoded signal can be converted to magnetized spots on a hard drive or tape drive the linecoded signal can be converted to pits on an optical discUnfortunately most longdistance communication channels cannot transport a DC componentThe DC component is also called the disparity the bias or the DC coefficientThe simplest possible line code called unipolar because it has an unbounded DC component gives too many errors on such systemsMost line codes eliminate the DC component  such codes are called DCbalanced zeroDC DCfree zerobias DC equalized etcThere are three ways of eliminating the DC component Use a constantweight code In other words each transmitted code word is corrected such that every code word that contains some positive or negative levels also contains enough of the opposite levels such that the average level over each code word is zero For example Manchester code and Interleaved 2 of 5 Use a paired disparity code In other words the transmitter has to make sure that every code word that averages to a negative level is paired with another code word that averages to a positive level Therefore it must keep track of the running DC buildup and always pick the code word that pushes the DC level back towards zero The receiver is designed so that either code word of the pair decodes to the same data bits For example AMI 8B10B 4B3T etc Use a scrambler For example the scrambler specified in RFC 2615 for 64b66b encodingLine coding should make it possible for the receiver to synchronize itself to the phase of the received signal If the synchronization is not ideal then the signal to be decoded will not have optimal differences in amplitude between the various digits or symbols used in the line code This will increase the error probability in the received dataIt is also preferred for the line code to have a structure that will enable error detectionNote that the linecoded signal and a signal produced at a terminal may differ thus requiring translationA line code will typically reflect technical requirements of the transmission medium such as optical fiber or shielded twisted pair These requirements are unique for each medium because each one has different behavior related to interference distortion capacitance and loss of amplitude Common line codes  AMI Modified AMI codes B8ZS B6ZS B3ZS HDB3 2B1Q

differential signaling the linecoded signal the baseband signal undergoes further pulse shaping to reduce its frequency bandwidth and then modulated to shift its frequency to create an RF signal that can be sent through free space the linecoded signal can be used to turn on and off a light source in freespace optical communication most commonly used in an infrared remote control the linecoded signal can be printed on paper to create a bar code the linecoded signal can be converted to magnetized spots on a hard drive or tape drive the linecoded signal can be converted to pits on an optical discUnfortunately most longdistance communication channels cannot transport a DC componentThe DC component is also called the disparity the bias or the DC coefficientThe simplest possible line code called unipolar because it has an unbounded DC component gives too many errors on such systemsMost line codes eliminate the DC component  such codes are called DCbalanced zeroDC DCfree zerobias DC equalized etcThere are three ways of eliminating the DC component Use a constantweight code In other words each transmitted code word is corrected such that every code word that contains some positive or negative levels also contains enough of the opposite levels such that the average level over each code word is zero For example Manchester code and Interleaved 2 of 5 Use a paired disparity code In other words the transmitter has to make sure that every code word that averages to a negative level is paired with another code word that averages to a positive level Therefore it must keep track of the running DC buildup and always pick the code word that pushes the DC level back towards zero The receiver is designed so that either code word of the pair decodes to the same data bits For example AMI 8B10B 4B3T etc Use a scrambler For example the scrambler specified in RFC 2615 for 64b66b encodingLine coding should make it possible for the receiver to synchronize itself to the phase of the received signal If the synchronization is not ideal then the signal to be decoded will not have optimal differences in amplitude between the various digits or symbols used in the line code This will increase the error probability in the received dataIt is also preferred for the line code to have a structure that will enable error detectionNote that the linecoded signal and a signal produced at a terminal may differ thus requiring translationA line code will typically reflect technical requirements of the transmission medium such as optical fiber or shielded twisted pair These requirements are unique for each medium because each one has different behavior related to interference distortion capacitance and loss of amplitude Common line codes  AMI Modified AMI codes B8ZS B6ZS B3ZS HDB3 2B1Q

This is about the defunct television system owned by Baton Broadcasting For the history of Baton Broadcasting itself see Bell MediaThe Baton Broadcast System Referred to by some sources as the Baton Broadcasting System The parent company was indeed Baton Broadcasting Inc but the correct meaning of the second B was Broadcast as indicated in Canadian trademark reg no TMA446418 and others BBS was a Canadian system of television stations located in Ontario and Saskatchewan owned by Baton Broadcasting BBS was the successor to two provincial systems also owned by Baton the Saskatchewan Television Network STN and Ontario Network Television ONTDuring the 1990s BBS and its predecessors served as a complementary programming service to the CTV Television Network to which most but not all of the systems stations were already affiliated Shortly after Batons acquisition of CTV in 1997 and the contemporaneous sale of Batons independent stations later reacquired by Bell and currently part of the parallel CTV Two system the BBS brand was eliminated and the systems operations were merged into the CTV networkHistoryBackgroundDuring its years as a cooperative CTV did not broadcast a complete primetime schedule During the late 1980s and early 1990s it broadcast 60 hours of common programming each week with a few gaps in primetime for affiliates to schedule locally in most cases stations could even pick when to air network programs Friends of Canadian Broadcasting television schedule archive comparison of different CTV affiliates spring 1990 schedules During this same period CTVs profits began to decline and by the early 1990s the network was posting losses largely due to increased competition from the CanWest Global System and other independent stations Many affiliate groups such as Baton and WIC ndash the latter already owning several independent stations ndash decided they would prefer to buy and air more of their own programming Accordingly as part of CTVs 1993 restructuring network programming was reduced to 425 hours and soon after to 40 including 12 hours in primetime Decision CRTC 9433 1994 CTV network licence renewal From this point on until 1998 CTV network programming only took up about half of affiliates primetime schedulesOntario Network Television 19911994ONT was initiated in 1991 consisting of eight CTV affiliates  seven owned by Baton CFTO CJOH CHRO and the MCTV stations and Electrohomes CKCO Initially providing 105 hours of common programming each week this was soon expanded to 35 hoursWhile it was a secondary affiliation and not a separate network from CTV some claimed ONT was a first step towards Baton becoming a separate network Indeed Baton began to bid against CTV for the rights to new US series However Batons president at the time Douglas Bassett contended it was merely a marketing vehicle to compete with CanWest Globals CIIITV a single station which served almost all of Ontario CTV The Television Wars Susan Gittins Toronto Stoddart Publishing 1999 In 1993 Baton acquired two independent stations CFPL and CKNX and launched a third CHWI These stations replaced CKCO within ONT In response CKCO and WICs CHCHTV Hamilton announced a joint initiative of their own known as Market One Television Stations join forces David Chilton Strategy July 12 1993 however this partnership was shortlivedIn addition to the CTV affiliates and independent stations some ONT and later BBS programming may have aired on Batons CBC affiliates part of twinstick operations in northern Ontario In the rest of Canada Baton sublicensed its programming to individual stations usually CTV affiliates Even the ONT brand was seen from time to time in the rest of Canada mainly through Batonproduced Toronto Blue Jays gamesThe BBS years 1994  1997CFTO BBS logoIn 1994 Baton hired the management consulting firm McKinsey  Company to help evaluate how to proceed with its national expansion plans McKinseys report recommended first and foremost that Baton attempt to take control of the CTV trademark which it saw as one of the most valuable brands in Canada through the acquisition of as many other CTV affiliates and their corresponding shares in the network as possible However the report also recommended that Baton create a new national brand as a backup to help reduce the damage should Batons gambit fail and CTV pass into a competitors hands This new brand turned out to be BBS with a logo adapted from the CFTO multicolourediris logo Batons local stations dropped their individual logos and adopted the new BBS symbol with the station call letters positioned beneath In contrast ONT was simply a secondary brand and had not replaced local station logos Despite the value Baton placed in the CTV brand BBS became more a more prominent part of these stations branding than CTV itselfBBS replaced ONT in fall 1994 with the addition of four Batonowned CTV affiliates and possibly two associated CBC affiliates in Saskatchewan that had been jointly branded as the Saskatchewan Television Network since the late 1980sProgramming included US series such as Law  Order Home Improvement and Ellen the soap opera Family Passions a Saturday morning block of mainly Disney cartoons branded as BBS Master Control including The Lion Kings Timon and Pumbaa and Disneys One Saturday Morning news and talk programming such as Sunday Edition and The Dini Petty Show and sports programming such as Blue Jays games which were again syndicated to other Canadian stationsAs a result of the BatonElectrohome Alliance CKCO now jointly owned by both companies rejoined the system in 1996 The two companies also jointly acquired CFCNTV in Calgary around the same time both it and Electrohomeowned CFRNTV in Edmonton aired much of the BBS lineup but did not actively use the BBS brand Internet Archive Wayback Machine for wwwcfrntvca and wwwcfcnca Acquisition of CTVBy late 1997 Baton Broadcasting had become the sole corporate owner of CTV acquiring several other CTV affiliates in the process Baton continued to consider the longstanding CTV brand much more preferable than its lesserknown BBS moniker and had not bothered to introduce the latter brand to its new acquisitionsAlmost immediately after its purchase of CTV was complete Baton introduced new station logos on all of its CTVaffiliated stations that incorporated the network brand and began using the CTV logo in all programming and promotions where the BBS logo was previously used even though these programs remained separate from the CTV network service proper The BBS name was completely dropped no later than the end of January 1998 and Baton itself would change its corporate name to CTV Inc later that year Nevertheless BBS lived on in a very limited sense until 2001 since CTV maintained a separate stream of programming not part of the CTV network service ndash though as noted above from this point on such shows were branded as CTV programs on the networks OOs This structure was necessary because the old CTVs affiliation agreements which generally limited network service to 40 hours a week remained in force For instance CHAN then known as BCTV was Vancouvers CTV affiliate but carried only 40 hours of CTV programming In fact this was sometimes less in its final seasons as a CTV affiliate BCTV did not broadcast Canada AM at all airing local news instead although sister station CHEK did air CanAM while CTVowned independent station CIVT carried the remainder As its establishment came shortly before Baton adopted the CTV name for its stations CIVT did not use the BBS name instead branding as Vancouver Television VTVOther affiliates such as CKY Winnipeg NTV in Newfoundland and Labrador and to a lesser extent CFCF Montreal usually acquired additional programming as they had from BBS However these programs were not added to the base 40hour network schedule which was part of a traditional network arrangement whereby the network retained most of the ad inventory and affiliates were compensated with airtime payments ndash instead stations had to pay the network for these additional programs although they would sell all ads locally which made the practice more akin to allcash syndication rather than the more contemporary US practice of reverse compensation Series would sometimes switch back and forth between network and nonnetwork status and in limited cases alternate programming was supplied to affiliates in the event that specific episodes of a nonnetwork program eg Who Wants to Be a Millionaire were scheduled for a timeslot that had been previously allocated as network time On September 1 2001 CIVT became the Vancouver CTV ownedandoperated station displacing BCTV and CHEK around the same time CTV acquired CKY and CFCF giving the networks OO stations group coverage of virtually all major Canadian centres As a result CTV elected not to renew its national network licence with the CRTC and the largely artificial distinction between network and nonnetwork programming was eliminated entirely at this point CTV would later reapply for a separate regional network licence used specifically to provide programming to affiliates owned by third parties In this sense CTV as it presently operates could be seen as an enlarged BBS by another name rather than the direct successor to the original CTV however for most viewers this is a technicality of little practical significanceBatons independents and newlydisaffiliated CHRO were sold to CHUM Limited becoming NewNet stations however CTVglobemedia now Bell Media Batons successor as a corporate entity reacquired them as part of its purchase of CHUM Limited in 2007 These stations are now operated by Bell Media under the CTV Two bannerBatons CBC affiliates were later sold to the public broadcaster and became repeaters of other CBC ownedandoperated stations CTVgm would later acquire another CBC affiliate CKXTV in Brandon Manitoba as part of the CHUM purchase which closed down

affiliate but carried only 40 hours of CTV programming In fact this was sometimes less in its final seasons as a CTV affiliate BCTV did not broadcast Canada AM at all airing local news instead although sister station CHEK did air CanAM while CTVowned independent station CIVT carried the remainder As its establishment came shortly before Baton adopted the CTV name for its stations CIVT did not use the BBS name instead branding as Vancouver Television VTVOther affiliates such as CKY Winnipeg NTV in Newfoundland and Labrador and to a lesser extent CFCF Montreal usually acquired additional programming as they had from BBS However these programs were not added to the base 40hour network schedule which was part of a traditional network arrangement whereby the network retained most of the ad inventory and affiliates were compensated with airtime payments ndash instead stations had to pay the network for these additional programs although they would sell all ads locally which made the practice more akin to allcash syndication rather than the more contemporary US practice of reverse compensation Series would sometimes switch back and forth between network and nonnetwork status and in limited cases alternate programming was supplied to affiliates in the event that specific episodes of a nonnetwork program eg Who Wants to Be a Millionaire were scheduled for a timeslot that had been previously allocated as network time On September 1 2001 CIVT became the Vancouver CTV ownedandoperated station displacing BCTV and CHEK around the same time CTV acquired CKY and CFCF giving the networks OO stations group coverage of virtually all major Canadian centres As a result CTV elected not to renew its national network licence with the CRTC and the largely artificial distinction between network and nonnetwork programming was eliminated entirely at this point CTV would later reapply for a separate regional network licence used specifically to provide programming to affiliates owned by third parties In this sense CTV as it presently operates could be seen as an enlarged BBS by another name rather than the direct successor to the original CTV however for most viewers this is a technicality of little practical significanceBatons independents and newlydisaffiliated CHRO were sold to CHUM Limited becoming NewNet stations however CTVglobemedia now Bell Media Batons successor as a corporate entity reacquired them as part of its purchase of CHUM Limited in 2007 These stations are now operated by Bell Media under the CTV Two bannerBatons CBC affiliates were later sold to the public broadcaster and became repeaters of other CBC ownedandoperated stations CTVgm would later acquire another CBC affiliate CKXTV in Brandon Manitoba as part of the CHUM purchase which closed down in late 2009 after a variety of efforts to sell the station failedList of BBS stationsAffiliations listed are those in effect during their participation in BBSOntarioKitchener  CKCO CTV Under the

brought on to lead a task for which the skillset did not exist within the company or in the case of a temp in the vernacular sense to perform busywork or an otherwise lowskilled repetitive task for which an employee is deemed too valuable to performNonemployees generally are employed by outside agencies or firms but perform their duties within a corporation or similar entity They do not have the same benefits as employees of that company such as paygrades health insurance or sick daysSome highskilled consultants however may garner some benefits such as a bonus sick leave or food and travel expenses since they usually charge a high flatfee for their services or otherwise garner high hourly wages An example of highskilled consultants include lawyers lobbyists and accountants who may not

The 2012 Pacific typhoon season was a fairly average and destructive season but rather active since 2004 The season became very active between midJuly and midAugust for nine named storms formed during the period Vicente underwent explosive intensification and made landfall over the west Pearl River Delta as a strong typhoon Damrey developed into a typhoon in the Yellow Sea and became the most intense tropical cyclone to made landfall north of the Yangtze River since 1949 Typhoon Haikui although far away from the Philippines killed at least 89 people in the country Typhoon Tembin affected Taiwan twice because of its cyclonic loopFrom late August to September three very powerful typhoons Bolaven Sanba and Jelawat directly hit Okinawa Island successively In October the remnants of Severe Tropical Storm Gaemi arrived at the Bay of Bengal and reintensified into a deep depression before making landfall over Bangladesh In December Typhoon Bopha an unusually very lowlatitude but very powerful tropical cyclone caused catastrophic damage in Mindanao where was just severely afftected by Severe Tropical Storm Washi in 2011 Bopha killed at least 1146 people and cost 104 billion 2012

16  During each season several national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many tropical cyclones tropical storms and typhoons will form during a season andor how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country These agencys include the Tropical Storm Risk Consortium of the University College London and the Guy Carpenter AsiaPacific Climate Impact Centre GCACIC of the City University of Hong Kong both of which have been issuing forecasts since the 2000 Pacific typhoon season However this year the GCACIC did not issue a forecast as their forecast had been overestimating how many tropical cyclones would develop during the last few seasons This season the Tropical Storm Risk Consortium TSR released an initial forecast on the number of tropical storms typhoons and intense typhoons that would develop during April before issuing updates during May July and August According to TSR An intense typhoon is a typhoon that has oneminute winds of at least 175 kmh 110 mph In its April forecast TSR predicted that the season would see activity about 10 below the 19652011 average however in its May update TSR reported that its forecast had increased slightly as a new forecast model had become available National meteorological service predictionsOn March 20 the Hong Kong Observatory predicted that the typhoon season in Hong Kong would start in June or slightly earlier with 58 tropical cyclones passing within 500 km of the territory On May 21 the Thai Meteorological Department predicted that 12 tropical storms would affect Thailand during 2012 They predicted that 1 would move through Vietnam and affect Upper Thailand during August or September while the other one was expected to move through Southern Thailand during October or November On August 13 PAGASA predicted that 7  10 tropical cyclones were likely to develop within or enter the Philippine area of responsibility between July and September while 4  7 were predicted to occur between October and December On August 31 the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau predicted that 8 more tropical cyclones could develop near Taiwan in addition to the 15 that had already developed they also predicted that one or two of these were predicted to significantly affect the island nation Season summaryImageSize  width800 height250PlotArea  top10 bottom80 right20 left20Legend  columns2 left30

textDecemberStormsTropical Depression 01WEarly on February 17 the JMA reported that a tropical depression had developed about 800 km to the southeast of Manila on the Philippine island of Luzon During that day the depression moved westwards before the Joint Typhoon Warning Center initiated advisories at 1500 UTC and designated the system as Tropical Depression 01W However six hours later the JTWC issued its final advisory as vertical windshear had started to increase and after it had found no deep convection near the systems low level circulation centre during a reassessment of the depressions low level structure Over the next few days the JMA continued to monitor the depression before it was last noted during February 20 Heavy rains associated with the outer bands of the system triggered widespread flooding and several landslides in the western Philippines At least two people were killed and another was listed as missing Three homes were destroyed and five others were damaged as a result of the storm Overall nearly 30000 people were affected by the storm and losses exceeded 40 million US1 million Tropical Storm PakharOn March 28 the JTWC issued a TCFA on the tropical depression as its LLCC began to consolidate more Early on March 29 the JMA upgraded the tropical depression to a tropical storm and named it Pakhar because the storms convection had completely wrapped around the circulation center Early on March 30 the JTWC upgraded Pakhar to a Category 1 typhoon as a banding eye formed Because of land interaction and colder sea surface temperatures the JTWC downgraded Pakhar to a tropical storm early on March 31 On April 1 Pakhar made landfall near Vung Tau Vietnam and began to weaken Early on April 2 the JMA reported that Pakhar had weakened into a tropical depression before they reported later that day that the system had dissipated over Cambodia Although Pakhar did not affect the Philippines as a tropical cyclone its precursor produced heavy rains across part of the nation Flooding occurred in different parts of central and southern Luzon and the northern Visayas region In Basud Camarines Norte 128 families had to be evacuated due to flash flooding A few landslides resulted from the rains damaging or destroying a few homes Throughout the affected region five people were killed and three others were listed as missing In Vietnam four people were killed and several others were injured due to flash flooding and high winds The hardest hit area was Khanh Hoa province where the storm made landfall About 4400 homes were damaged in the region by the storm and thousands of acres of rice paddy were flooded In Ho Chi Minh City officials reported that 600 homes and schools were destroyed The remnants of the system brought rains to parts of Cambodia Laos and Thailand Severe Tropical Storm SanvuOn May 20 the JMA reported that a tropical depression had developed about to the southeast of Guam  Late on May 27 the JMA reported that Sanvu had degenerated into an extratropical low before the remnants dissipated during May 30 Sanvu brought tropical storm force wind gusts and between 15  of rainfall to parts of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands However the only damage reported was on Guam where falling tree limbs caused an estimated of damage to power lines Typhoon Mawar AmboMawar brought torrential rain to parts of the Philippines including the Bicol Region while enhancing the southwest monsoon which triggered delays and cancelled of air flights In Bicol region more than 332 passengers were stranded at ports due to Mawar httpwwwgmanetworkcomnewsstory260247newsregionscoastguard332strandedinbicolduetoambo Different domestic and international flights were forced to divert at Clark Air Base rather than NAIA due to bad

ButchoyBetween June 14 and 18 Guchol enhanced the southwestern monsoon over the Philippines resulting in widespread rains However the effects of these rains were limited and only one fatality took place In Japan airlines cancelled 420 domestic and international flights because of the strong winds affecting 32600 passengers The town of Nachikatsuura some 400 kilometres southwest of Tokyo ordered nearly 1600 residents to evacuate warning of the danger of landslides brought on by heavy rain media reports saidAt least two people were killed and eighty others were injured across the country Total economic losses were estimated in excess of 8 billion US100 million Severe Tropical Storm Talim CarinaTropical Storm Doksuri DindoOn June 25 the JMA started to monitor a tropical depression that had developed within the monsoon trough about to the southeast of Manilla Philippines During that day the depression moved northwestwards and consolidated further before during the next day PAGASA started to monitor it as Tropical Depression Dindo Later that day the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Doksuri and the JTWC upgraded Doksuri to a tropical depression Late on the same day the JTWC upgraded Doksuri to a tropical storm On June 27 Doksuris lowlevel circulation center became exposed due to moderate easterly wind shear On June 28 the JTWC downgraded Doksuri to a tropical depression as the systems exposed circulation center began to undergo an unusual circulation center replacement cycle which involves a circulation center to be replaced by another new circulation center Late on June 29 Doksuri made landfall over Zhuhai Guangdong China During June 30 the JMA reported that Doksuri had weakened into a tropical depression before reporting that the depression had dissipated later that day In Macau the storm caused minor roof damage Severe Tropical Storm Khanun Enteng while in North Korea staterun media reported that at least seven people were killed in Kangwon province with an eighth fatality reported elsewhere It said the storm caused significant damage destroying 650 dwelling houses 30 public buildings railways roads bridges and various systems The flooding also inundated nearly 3870 homes leaving more than 16250 people homeless On July 29 the North Korean government dramatically raised the death toll in the country to 88 with an additional 134 injured The biggest loss of human life was in two counties of South Pyongan Province At least 63000 were made homeless by the flooding while more than 30000 hectares of land for growing crops were submerged and will add to growing fears of another looming famine in the country Three hundred public buildings and 60 factories were damaged during the storm Typhoon Vicente FerdieOriginally Khanuns large area of convention on July 16 the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression on July 18 On July 20 the JTWC issued a TCFA on the system soon the PAGASA upgraded it to a tropical depression and named it Ferdie The JTWC also upgraded the system to a tropical depression late on the same day After the system moved into the South China Sea on July 21 the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Vicente so did the JTWC On July 23 due to weak vertical wind shear and high sea surface temperature Vicente started to undergo an explosive intensification prompting the JMA to upgrade Vicente to a typhoon and the JTWC upgraded Vicente to a category 4 typhoon later At 1645 UTC the HKO issued the Hurricane Signal No 10 the first since Typhoon York in 1999 Later Typhoon Vicente made landfall over Taishan in Guangdong China Due to land interaction the JMA downgraded Vicente to a severe tropical storm early on July 24 and the JTWC downgraded Vicente to a category 3 typhoon Late on the same day the JMA downgraded Vicente to a tropical depression Typhoon Saola GenerOn July 26 the JMA reported that a tropical depression had developed within an area of strong vertical windshear in the monsoon trough about to the southeast of Manila in the PhilippinesEarly on July 28 the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression whilst the JMA upgraded it to

upgraded Saola to a severe tropical storm On July 30 the JTWC upgraded Saola to a category 1 typhoon as it started to develop an eyelike feature but soon downgraded it to a tropical storm late on the same day Late on July 31 the JMA upgraded Saola to a typhoon It continued to intensify the next day reaching its peak intensity as a Category 2 typhoonMost forecast models predicts Saola to pass very near on the northern coastline of Taiwan but this is defied on August 1 when Saola had made landfall on Taiwan as a Category 2 typhoon It moved slowly inland making a counterclockwise loop It made out to sea now downgraded as a severe tropical storm Just then did Saola passed very close to the northern coastline of Taiwan then it headed straight for China On August 3 it made landfall near Fuding Fujian Province as a tropical storm then headed straight inland until on the next day when Saola dissipated near JiangxiTyphoon DamreyOriginally a coldcore low the system became a tropical disturbance southwest of Minamitorishima late on July 26 Early on July 27 the Japan Meteorological Agency JMA upgraded it to a tropical depression On July 28 the Joint Typhoon Warning Center JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system before the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Damrey Late on the same day the JTWC upgraded Damrey to a tropical depression and even upgraded it to a tropical storm on the next day After Damrey had drifted slowly for two days the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm northeast of Chichijima late on July 30 when the storm began to accelerate moving westnorthwest and form a banding eye On August 1 the JTWC upgraded Damrey to a category 1 typhoon while the system passed through the sumi Islands in Japan as it started to develop an well defined eye When Damrey drifted towards Yellow Sea on August 2 the JMA upgraded it to a typhoon Soon Typhoon Damrey made landfall over Xiangshui County in Jiangsu China at 1330 UTC 2130 CST The system then dissipated near Hebei on August 4 Typhoon HaikuiLate on July 31 a tropical disturbance formed within a large monsoon trough On August 1 the Japan Meteorological Agency JMA

the JMA reported that the system had become extratropical However the JMA designated it as a tropical storm with the name Kirogi early on August 8 Early on August 9 the JTWC downgraded Kirogi to a tropical depression Later the JMA upgraded Kirogi to a severe tropical stormit reached its peak intensity while the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm again Late on the same day the JTWC issued the final warning to Kirogi as it was becoming an extratropical system The remnants of the system then entered the Sea of Okhotsk where it dissipated over SiberiaTyphoon Kaitak HelenThe monsoonal trough spawned a tropical disturbance early on August 10 which had organizing convection and a weak circulation Early on August 12 the Japan Meteorological Agency JMA started tracking the system as a weak Tropical Depression with winds under 30 knots Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration PAGASA started issuing advisories on the system naming it Helen That day the JTWC also initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 14W Early on August 13 the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Kaitak and 9 hours later the JTWC followed suit Later the same day the JMA upgraded it to a Severe Tropical Storm On August 15 the convection increased as outflow improved and the JTWC upgraded Kaitak to a typhoon The storm continued towards China with deepening convection due to decreasing wind shear However it was only at 0000 UTC on August 16 when the JMA officially declared Kaitak a typhoon At the same time the PAGASA issued their last warning on Kaitak otherwise known as Helen locally as it left the Philippine area of Responsibility On the morning of August 17 Kaitak made landfall over the Leizhou peninsula in southern China as a typhoon Within 6 hours Kaitak made a second landfall over the northeast coast of Vietnam and weakened slightly to a tropical storm Later that night the JTWC issued their final warning on the system as it weakened further and sped up inland The JMA stopped tracking the storm early the next morning no longer considering it a tropical cyclone Typhoon Tembin IgmeOn August 16 a tropical disturbance formed southeast of Taiwan On August 17 the JMA mentioned it as a tropical depression as a subtropical ridge pushed the system southwards The JTWC issued a TCFA on the system late on August 18 early on the next day the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Tembin and the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression Soon the PAGASA also upgraded it to a tropical depression and named it Igme On August 20 Tembin entered a period of explosive intensification by excellent dual outflow prompting both the JMA and the JTWC upgrading it to a typhoon On August 22 Tembin began to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle as it further weakened to a category 1 typhoon On August 23 Tembin reintensified into a category 3 typhoon before it made landfall over Pingtung Taiwan later on the same day Due to minor land interaction the JMA downgraded Tembin to a severe tropical storm early on August 24 and the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm later Typhoon Bolaven JulianForming as a tropical depression on August 19 to the southwest of the Mariana Islands Bolaven steadily intensified as it slowly moved westnorthwestward in a region favoring tropical development The system was soon upgraded to a tropical storm less than a day after formation and further to a typhoon by August 21 Strengthening became more gradual thereafter as Bolaven grew in size On August 24 the system attained its peak intensity with winds of 185 kmh 115 mph and a barometric pressure of 910 mbar hPa 2687 inHg Weakening only slightly the storm passed directly over Okinawa on August 26 as it began accelerating toward the north Steady weakening continued as Bolaven approached the Korean Peninsula and it eventually made landfall in North Korea late on August 28 before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone The remnants rapidly tracked northeastward and was last noted over the Russian Far East Although Bolaven struck the Ryukyu Islands as a powerful typhoon damage was less than expected Relatively few buildings were damaged or destroyed across the region The most significant effects stemmed from heavy rains amounting to 5515 mm that caused flash flooding and landslides One person drowned on Amami shima after being swept away by a swollen river In mainland Japan two people drowned after being swept away by rough seas In South Korea 19 people were killed by the storm Many buildings were damaged and approximately 19 million homes were left without power Losses in the country reached 420 billion US3743 million the majority of which was due to destroyed apple orchards Significant damage also took place in North Korea where at least 59 people were killed and 50 others were reported missing Additionally 6700 homes were destroyed Offshore nine people drowned after two Chinese vessels sank Typhoon Sanba KarenA lowpressure area formed east of Palau on September 9 On September 10 both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression As the system entered the PAR early on September 11 the PAGASA named it Karen At the same time the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Sanba and the JTWC also upgraded it to a tropical storm later In Kchi Prefecture Japan 222 hectares 548 acres of agricultural land was damaged by the storm with losses reaching 50 million US640000 Throughout Okinawa damage to agriculture forestry and fisheries amounted to 900 million US115 million Typhoon Jelawat Lawin On September 30 it made landfall on Japan then on October 1 the system became an extratropical cyclone httpwwwnasagovmissionpageshurricanesarchives2012h2012Jelawathtml Severe Tropical Storm EwiniarEarly on September 22 a tropical disturbance formed west of Guam out of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and the JMA upgraded it to a tropical depression on the next day On September 24 the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression as it became better organized however the low level circulation center remained exposed due to outflow wind shear from Jelawat which pushed the convection to the east of the system and prevented it from strengthening more quickly On September 24 the JTWC further upgraded the system to a minimal tropical storm and named it Ewiniar as the system started moving away from Jelawat which allowed it to strengthenOn September 27 with the system far from Jelawats outflow the exposed low level circulation center was wrapped with convection and the JMA upgraded the system to a Severe tropical Storm A small eyelike feature showed up in the satellite image of Ewiniar On September 29 the system became totally exposed with the convection being blown away by strong vertical wind shear It became extratropical the next day httpwwwnasagovmissionpageshurricanesarchives2012h2012Ewiniarhtml Severe Tropical Storm MaliksiOn September 27 a large tropical disturbance formed near Chuuk On September 29 the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression On October 1 the system was upgraded into a tropical storm and named Maliksi The large storm developed a mid level circulation center with Microwave satellite imagery showing that the storm has becamed less organized during the morning hours of Oct 2 because it has become slightly elongated and on October 3 the JMA upgraded it to Severe Tropical Storm and the storms center soon passed over Iwo To High wind shear and unfavorable conditions made it weaken as it started transitioning to an extratropical system On October 4 it became fully extratropical with wind shear from the southwest which has pushed most of the showers and thunderstorms northeast of the center of circulation httpwwwnasagovmissionpageshurricanesarchives2012h2012Maliksihtml Severe Tropical Storm Gaemi MarceOn September 29 the JMA reported that a tropical depression that had developed within the monsoon trough about 745 km to the northwest of Ho Chi Minh City in Southern Vietnam As the tropical depression organized large powerful thunderstorms with very cold cloud top temperatures colder than 63F52 C surrounded the center of circulation hinting that the storm was organizing and strengthening The system remained quasistationary over the next 12 hours due to weak steering environment On October 1 the system strengthened into a tropical storm httpwwwnasagovmissionpageshurricanesarchives2012h2012Gaemihtml Typhoon Prapiroon NinaOn October 5 the JMA started to monitor a tropical depression that had developed about 115 km to the northeast of Hagta Guam As the JMA upgraded the storm to a Severe Tropical Storm on October 8 rapid convection produced a tightly wrapped system with multiple deep convective bands wrapping into a welldefined low level circulation center On October 9 the JTWC and the JMA upgraded the system to a typhoon On October 11 as the system developed a ragged eye the JTWC upgraded Prapiroon further to a category 2 typhoon The ragged eye soon became well defined as seen in Microwave imagery later that day and was soon upgraded further to a category 3 typhoon On October 15 as the system ws pushed south by an anticyclone ridging in from the north and caused it to made a small cyclonic loop On October 16 an Anticyclone located on the north west of Prapiroon became slightly displaced to the southeast which brought wind shear to Prapiroons northern peripherys convection to be pushed to the south and caused a strong southern outflow On October 19 Prapiroon transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it became bombarded by strong vertical wind shear httpwwwnasagovmissionpageshurricanesarchives2012h2012Prapiroonhtml Severe Tropical Storm MariaOn October 13 the JMA upgraded an area of disturbed weather into a tropical depression while the JTWC reported that the disturbance lay 50 nmi eastsoutheast of Pagan in the Northern Mariana Islands As it moved westward it strengthened to become Tropical Storm Maria on October 14 Early the next day the JMA upgraded the Maria into a severe tropical storm On October 19 the systems low level circulation center became totally exposed with strong wind shear eroding the entire system into an exposed vortex almost devoid of convection as it slowed down on movement

The 2012 Pacific typhoon season was a fairly average and destructive season but rather active since 2004 The season became very active between midJuly and midAugust for nine named storms formed during the period Vicente underwent explosive intensification and made landfall over the west Pearl River Delta as a strong typhoon Damrey developed into a typhoon in the Yellow Sea and became the most intense tropical cyclone to made landfall north of the Yangtze River since 1949 Typhoon Haikui although far away from the Philippines killed at least 89 people in the country Typhoon Tembin affected Taiwan twice because of its cyclonic loopFrom late August to September three very powerful typhoons Bolaven Sanba and Jelawat directly hit Okinawa Island successively In October the remnants of Severe Tropical Storm Gaemi arrived at the Bay of Bengal and reintensified into a deep depression before making landfall over Bangladesh In December Typhoon Bopha an unusually very lowlatitude but very powerful tropical cyclone caused catastrophic damage in Mindanao where was just severely afftected by Severe Tropical Storm Washi in 2011 Bopha killed at least 1146 people and cost 104 billion 2012 USD in the Philippines becoming the deadliest storm worldwide in 2012 and the costliest Philippine typhoon in historySeasonal forecasts ForecastCenter Date Tropicalstorms    TSR Average19652011 262

16  During each season several national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many tropical cyclones tropical storms and typhoons will form during a season andor how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country These agencys include the Tropical Storm Risk Consortium of the University College London and the Guy Carpenter AsiaPacific Climate Impact Centre GCACIC of the City University of Hong Kong both of which have been issuing forecasts since the 2000 Pacific typhoon season However this year the GCACIC did not issue a forecast as their forecast had been overestimating how many tropical cyclones would develop during the last few seasons This season the Tropical Storm Risk Consortium TSR released an initial forecast on the number of tropical storms typhoons and intense typhoons that would develop during April before issuing updates during May July and August According to TSR An intense typhoon is a typhoon that has oneminute winds of at least 175 kmh 110 mph In its April forecast TSR predicted that the season would see activity about 10 below the 19652011 average however in its May update TSR reported that its forecast had increased slightly as a new forecast model had become available National meteorological service predictionsOn March 20 the Hong Kong Observatory predicted that the typhoon season in Hong Kong would start in June or slightly earlier with 58 tropical cyclones passing within 500 km of the territory On May 21 the Thai Meteorological Department predicted that 12 tropical storms would affect Thailand during 2012 They predicted that 1 would move through Vietnam and affect Upper Thailand during August or September while the other one was expected to move through Southern Thailand during October or November On August 13 PAGASA predicted that 7  10 tropical cyclones were likely to develop within or enter the Philippine area of responsibility between July and September while 4  7 were predicted to occur between October and December On August 31 the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau predicted that 8 more tropical cyclones could develop near Taiwan in addition to the 15 that had already developed they also predicted that one or two of these were predicted to significantly affect the island nation Season summaryImageSize  width800 height250PlotArea  top10 bottom80 right20 left20Legend  columns2 left30

textDecemberStormsTropical Depression 01WEarly on February 17 the JMA reported that a tropical depression had developed about 800 km to the southeast of Manila on the Philippine island of Luzon During that day the depression moved westwards before the Joint Typhoon Warning Center initiated advisories at 1500 UTC and designated the system as Tropical Depression 01W However six hours later the JTWC issued its final advisory as vertical windshear had started to increase and after it had found no deep convection near the systems low level circulation centre during a reassessment of the depressions low level structure Over the next few days the JMA continued to monitor the depression before it was last noted during February 20 Heavy rains associated with the outer bands of the system triggered widespread flooding and several landslides in the western Philippines At least two people were killed and another was listed as missing Three homes were destroyed and five others were damaged as a result of the storm Overall nearly 30000 people were affected by the storm and losses exceeded 40 million US1 million Tropical Storm PakharOn March 28 the JTWC issued a TCFA on the tropical depression as its LLCC began to consolidate more Early on March 29 the JMA upgraded the tropical depression to a tropical storm and named it Pakhar because the storms convection had completely wrapped around the circulation center Early on March 30 the JTWC upgraded Pakhar to a Category 1 typhoon as a banding eye formed Because of land interaction and colder sea surface temperatures the JTWC downgraded Pakhar to a tropical storm early on March 31 On April 1 Pakhar made landfall near Vung Tau Vietnam and began to weaken Early on April 2 the JMA reported that Pakhar had weakened into a tropical depression before they reported later that day that the system had dissipated over Cambodia Although Pakhar did not affect the Philippines as a tropical cyclone its precursor produced heavy rains across part of the nation Flooding occurred in different parts of central and southern Luzon and the northern Visayas region In Basud Camarines Norte 128 families had to be evacuated due to flash flooding A few landslides resulted from the rains damaging or destroying a few homes Throughout the affected region five people were killed and three others were listed as missing In Vietnam four people were killed and several others were injured due to flash flooding and high winds The hardest hit area was Khanh Hoa province where the storm made landfall About 4400 homes were damaged in the region by the storm and thousands of acres of rice paddy were flooded In Ho Chi Minh City officials reported that 600 homes and schools were destroyed The remnants of the system brought rains to parts of Cambodia Laos and Thailand Severe Tropical Storm SanvuOn May 20 the JMA reported that a tropical depression had developed about to the southeast of Guam  Late on May 27 the JMA reported that Sanvu had degenerated into an extratropical low before the remnants dissipated during May 30 Sanvu brought tropical storm force wind gusts and between 15  of rainfall to parts of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands However the only damage reported was on Guam where falling tree limbs caused an estimated of damage to power lines Typhoon Mawar AmboMawar brought torrential rain to parts of the Philippines including the Bicol Region while enhancing the southwest monsoon which triggered delays and cancelled of air flights In Bicol region more than 332 passengers were stranded at ports due to Mawar httpwwwgmanetworkcomnewsstory260247newsregionscoastguard332strandedinbicolduetoambo Different domestic and international flights were forced to divert at Clark Air Base rather than NAIA due to bad

httpwwwgmanetworkcomnewsstory260073newsregionscoastguardtoeastvisayasfishermendontventureouttoseaamidweatherdisturbance At least three were reported dead due to rains brought by Mawar Typhoon Guchol ButchoyBetween June 14 and 18 Guchol enhanced the southwestern monsoon over the Philippines resulting in widespread rains However the effects of these rains were limited and only one fatality took place In Japan airlines cancelled 420 domestic and international flights because of the strong winds affecting 32600 passengers The town of Nachikatsuura some 400 kilometres southwest of Tokyo ordered nearly 1600 residents to evacuate warning of the danger of landslides brought on by heavy rain media reports saidAt least two people were killed and eighty others were injured across the country Total economic losses were estimated in excess of 8 billion US100 million Severe Tropical Storm Talim CarinaTropical Storm Doksuri DindoOn June 25 the JMA started to monitor a tropical depression that had developed within the monsoon trough about to the southeast of Manilla Philippines During that day the depression moved northwestwards and consolidated further before during the next day PAGASA started to monitor it as Tropical Depression Dindo Later that day the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Doksuri and the JTWC upgraded Doksuri to a tropical depression Late on the same day the JTWC upgraded Doksuri to a tropical storm On June 27 Doksuris lowlevel circulation center became exposed due to moderate easterly wind shear On June 28 the JTWC downgraded Doksuri to a tropical depression as the systems exposed circulation center began to undergo an unusual circulation center replacement cycle which involves a circulation center to be replaced by another new circulation center Late on June 29 Doksuri made landfall over Zhuhai Guangdong China During June 30 the JMA reported that Doksuri had weakened into a tropical depression before reporting that the depression had dissipated later that day In Macau the storm caused minor roof damage Severe Tropical Storm Khanun Enteng while in North Korea staterun media reported that at least seven people were killed in Kangwon province with an eighth fatality reported elsewhere It said the storm caused significant damage destroying 650 dwelling houses 30 public buildings railways roads bridges and various systems The flooding also inundated nearly 3870 homes leaving more than 16250 people homeless On July 29 the North Korean government dramatically raised the death toll in the country to 88 with an additional 134 injured The biggest loss of human life was in two counties of South Pyongan Province At least 63000 were made homeless by the flooding while more than 30000 hectares of land for growing crops were submerged and will add to growing fears of another looming famine in the country Three hundred public buildings and 60 factories were damaged during the storm Typhoon Vicente FerdieOriginally Khanuns large area of convention on July 16 the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression on July 18 On July 20 the JTWC issued a TCFA on the system soon the PAGASA upgraded it to a tropical depression and named it Ferdie The JTWC also upgraded the system to a tropical depression late on the same day After the system moved into the South China Sea on July 21 the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Vicente so did the JTWC On July 23 due to weak vertical wind shear and high sea surface temperature Vicente started to undergo an explosive intensification prompting the JMA to upgrade Vicente to a typhoon and the JTWC upgraded Vicente to a category 4 typhoon later At 1645 UTC the HKO issued the Hurricane Signal No 10 the first since Typhoon York in 1999 Later Typhoon Vicente made landfall over Taishan in Guangdong China Due to land interaction the JMA downgraded Vicente to a severe tropical storm early on July 24 and the JTWC downgraded Vicente to a category 3 typhoon Late on the same day the JMA downgraded Vicente to a tropical depression Typhoon Saola GenerOn July 26 the JMA reported that a tropical depression had developed within an area of strong vertical windshear in the monsoon trough about to the southeast of Manila in the PhilippinesEarly on July 28 the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression whilst the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Saola Soon the PAGASA upgraded the system to a tropical depression and named it Gener Later that day the JTWC upgraded Saola to a tropical storm Early on July 29 the JMA upgraded Saola to a severe tropical storm On July 30 the JTWC upgraded Saola to a category 1 typhoon as it started to develop an eyelike feature but soon downgraded it to a tropical storm late on the same day Late on July 31 the JMA upgraded Saola to a typhoon It continued to intensify the next day reaching its peak intensity as a Category 2 typhoonMost forecast models predicts Saola to pass very near on the northern coastline of Taiwan but this is defied on August 1 when Saola had made landfall on Taiwan as a Category 2 typhoon It moved slowly inland making a counterclockwise loop It made out to sea now downgraded as a severe tropical storm Just then did Saola passed very close to the northern coastline of Taiwan then it headed straight for China On August 3 it made landfall near Fuding Fujian Province as a tropical storm then headed straight inland until on the next day when Saola dissipated near JiangxiTyphoon DamreyOriginally a coldcore low the system became a tropical disturbance southwest of Minamitorishima late on July 26 Early on July 27 the Japan Meteorological Agency JMA upgraded it to a tropical depression On July 28 the Joint Typhoon Warning Center JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system before the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Damrey Late on the same day the JTWC upgraded Damrey to a tropical depression and even upgraded it to a tropical storm on the next day After Damrey had drifted slowly for two days the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm northeast of Chichijima late on July 30 when the storm began to accelerate moving westnorthwest and form a banding eye On August 1 the JTWC upgraded Damrey to a category 1 typhoon while the system passed through the sumi Islands in Japan as it started to develop an well defined eye When Damrey drifted towards Yellow Sea on August 2 the JMA upgraded it to a typhoon Soon Typhoon Damrey made landfall over Xiangshui County in Jiangsu China at 1330 UTC 2130 CST The system then dissipated near Hebei on August 4 Typhoon HaikuiLate on July 31 a tropical disturbance formed within a large monsoon trough On August 1 the Japan Meteorological Agency JMA mentioned the system as a tropical depression southeast of Iwo Jima and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert late on the same day Late on August 2 the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression before the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Haikui early on the next day Early on August 4 the JTWC upgraded Haikui to a tropical storm On August 5 the JMA upgraded Haikui to a severe tropical storm when it was located northnortheast of Kume Island Later Typhoon Haikui made landfall over Xiangshan County in Zhejiang China at 1920 UTC 0320 CST on August 8 Severe Tropical Storm KirogiOn August 3 the JMA reported that a tropical depression had developed within the monsoon trough about to the northwest of Wake Island On August 4 the JTWC issued a TCFA on this subtropical system and later upgraded the system to a tropical depression late on the same day On August 5 the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm Early on August 6 the JMA reported that the system had become extratropical However the JMA designated it as a tropical storm with the name Kirogi early on August 8 Early on August 9 the JTWC downgraded Kirogi to a tropical depression Later the JMA upgraded Kirogi to a severe tropical stormit reached its peak intensity while the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm again Late on the same day the JTWC issued the final warning to Kirogi as it was becoming an extratropical system The remnants of the system then entered the Sea of Okhotsk where it dissipated over SiberiaTyphoon Kaitak HelenThe monsoonal trough spawned a tropical disturbance early on August 10 which had organizing convection and a weak circulation Early on August 12 the Japan Meteorological Agency JMA started tracking the system as a weak Tropical Depression with winds under 30 knots Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration PAGASA started issuing advisories on the system naming it Helen That day the JTWC also initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 14W Early on August 13 the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Kaitak and 9 hours later the JTWC followed suit Later the same day the JMA upgraded it to a Severe Tropical Storm On August 15 the convection increased as outflow improved and the JTWC upgraded Kaitak to a typhoon The storm continued towards China with deepening convection due to decreasing wind shear However it was only at 0000 UTC on August 16 when the JMA officially declared Kaitak a typhoon At the same time the PAGASA issued their last warning on Kaitak otherwise known as Helen locally as it left the Philippine area of Responsibility On the morning of August 17 Kaitak made landfall over the Leizhou peninsula in southern China as a typhoon Within 6 hours Kaitak made a second landfall over the northeast coast of Vietnam and weakened slightly to a tropical storm Later that night the JTWC issued their final warning on the system as it weakened further and sped up inland The JMA stopped tracking the storm early the next morning no longer considering it a tropical cyclone Typhoon Tembin IgmeOn August 16 a tropical disturbance formed southeast of Taiwan On August 17 the JMA mentioned it as a tropical depression as a subtropical ridge pushed the system southwards The JTWC issued a TCFA on the system late on August 18 early on the next day the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Tembin and the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression Soon the PAGASA also upgraded it to a tropical depression and named it Igme On August 20 Tembin entered a period of explosive intensification by excellent dual outflow prompting both the JMA and the JTWC upgrading it to a typhoon On August 22 Tembin began to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle as it further weakened to a category 1 typhoon On August 23 Tembin reintensified into a category 3 typhoon before it made landfall over Pingtung Taiwan later on the same day Due to minor land interaction the JMA downgraded Tembin to a severe tropical storm early on August 24 and the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm later Typhoon Bolaven JulianForming as a tropical depression on August 19 to the southwest of the Mariana Islands Bolaven steadily intensified as it slowly moved westnorthwestward in a region favoring tropical development The system was soon upgraded to a tropical storm less than a day after formation and further to a typhoon by August 21 Strengthening became more gradual thereafter as Bolaven grew in size On August 24 the system attained its peak intensity with winds of 185 kmh 115 mph and a barometric pressure of 910 mbar hPa 2687 inHg Weakening only slightly the storm passed directly over Okinawa on August 26 as it began accelerating toward the north Steady weakening continued as Bolaven approached the Korean Peninsula and it eventually made landfall in North Korea late on August 28 before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone The remnants rapidly tracked northeastward and was last noted over the Russian Far East Although Bolaven struck the Ryukyu Islands as a powerful typhoon damage was less than expected Relatively few buildings were damaged or destroyed across the region The most significant effects stemmed from heavy rains amounting to 5515 mm that caused flash flooding and landslides One person drowned on Amami shima after being swept away by a swollen river In mainland Japan two people drowned after being swept away by rough seas In South Korea 19 people were killed by the storm Many buildings were damaged and approximately 19 million homes were left without power Losses in the country reached 420 billion US3743 million the majority of which was due to destroyed apple orchards Significant damage also took place in North Korea where at least 59 people were killed and 50 others were reported missing Additionally 6700 homes were destroyed Offshore nine people drowned after two Chinese vessels sank Typhoon Sanba KarenA lowpressure area formed east of Palau on September 9 On September 10 both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression As the system entered the PAR early on September 11 the PAGASA named it Karen At the same time the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Sanba and the JTWC also upgraded it to a tropical storm later In Kchi Prefecture Japan 222 hectares 548 acres of agricultural land was damaged by the storm with losses reaching 50 million US640000 Throughout Okinawa damage to agriculture forestry and fisheries amounted to 900 million US115 million Typhoon Jelawat Lawin On September 30 it made landfall on Japan then on October 1 the system became an extratropical cyclone httpwwwnasagovmissionpageshurricanesarchives2012h2012Jelawathtml Severe Tropical Storm EwiniarEarly on September 22 a tropical disturbance formed west of Guam out of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and the JMA upgraded it to a tropical depression on the next day On September 24 the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression as it became better organized however the low level circulation center remained exposed due to outflow wind shear from Jelawat which pushed the convection to the east of the system and prevented it from strengthening more quickly On September 24 the JTWC further upgraded the system to a minimal tropical storm and named it Ewiniar as the system started moving away from Jelawat which allowed it to strengthenOn September 27 with the system far from Jelawats outflow the exposed low level circulation center was wrapped with convection and the JMA upgraded the system to a Severe tropical Storm A small eyelike feature showed up in the satellite image of Ewiniar On September 29 the system became totally exposed with the convection being blown away by strong vertical wind shear It became extratropical the next day httpwwwnasagovmissionpageshurricanesarchives2012h2012Ewiniarhtml Severe Tropical Storm MaliksiOn September 27 a large tropical disturbance formed near Chuuk On September 29 the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression On October 1 the system was upgraded into a tropical storm and named Maliksi The large storm developed a mid level circulation center with Microwave satellite imagery showing that the storm has becamed less organized during the morning hours of Oct 2 because it has become slightly elongated and on October 3 the JMA upgraded it to Severe Tropical Storm and the storms center soon passed over Iwo To High wind shear and unfavorable conditions made it weaken as it started transitioning to an extratropical system On October 4 it became fully extratropical with wind shear from the southwest which has pushed most of the showers and thunderstorms northeast of the center of circulation httpwwwnasagovmissionpageshurricanesarchives2012h2012Maliksihtml Severe Tropical Storm Gaemi MarceOn September 29 the JMA reported that a tropical depression that had developed within the monsoon trough about 745 km to the northwest of Ho Chi Minh City in Southern Vietnam As the tropical depression organized large powerful thunderstorms with very cold cloud top temperatures colder than 63F52 C surrounded the center of circulation hinting that the storm was organizing and strengthening The system remained quasistationary over the next 12 hours due to weak steering environment On October 1 the system strengthened into a tropical storm httpwwwnasagovmissionpageshurricanesarchives2012h2012Gaemihtml Typhoon Prapiroon NinaOn October 5 the JMA started to monitor a tropical depression that had developed about 115 km to the northeast of Hagta Guam As the JMA upgraded the storm to a Severe Tropical Storm on October 8 rapid convection produced a tightly wrapped system with multiple deep convective bands wrapping into a welldefined low level circulation center On October 9 the JTWC and the JMA upgraded the system to a typhoon On October 11 as the system developed a ragged eye the JTWC upgraded Prapiroon further to a category 2 typhoon The ragged eye soon became well defined as seen in Microwave imagery later that day and was soon upgraded further to a category 3 typhoon On October 15 as the system ws pushed south by an anticyclone ridging in from the north and caused it to made a small cyclonic loop On October 16 an Anticyclone located on the north west of Prapiroon became slightly displaced to the southeast which brought wind shear to Prapiroons northern peripherys convection to be pushed to the south and caused a strong southern outflow On October 19 Prapiroon transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it became bombarded by strong vertical wind shear httpwwwnasagovmissionpageshurricanesarchives2012h2012Prapiroonhtml Severe Tropical Storm MariaOn October 13 the JMA upgraded an area of disturbed weather into a tropical depression while the JTWC reported that the disturbance lay 50 nmi eastsoutheast of Pagan in the Northern Mariana Islands As it moved westward it strengthened to become Tropical Storm Maria on October 14 Early the next day the JMA upgraded the Maria into a severe tropical storm On October 19 the systems low level circulation center became totally exposed with strong wind shear eroding the entire system into an exposed vortex almost devoid of convection as it slowed down on movement httpwwwjmagojpentyph On October 20 the extratropical remnant low dissipated completely as it was a, <traceback object at 0x300a56518>

Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System ACARS is a digital datalink system for transmission of short relatively simple messages between aircraft and ground stations via radio or satellite The protocol which was designed by Aeronautical Radio Incorporated ARINC to replace their very high frequency VHF voice service and deployed in 1978 uses telex formats SITA later augmented their worldwide ground data network by adding radio stations to provide ACARS service Over the next 20 years ACARS will be superseded by the   ATN protocol for Air Traffic Control communications and by the Internet Protocol for airline communications History of ACARS Prior to the introduction of datalink all communication between the aircraft ie the flight crew and personnel on the ground was performed using voice communication This communication used either VHF or HF voice radios which was further augmented with SATCOM in the early 1990s In many cases the voicerelayed information involved dedicated radio operators and digital messages sent to an airline teletype system or its successor systems Introduction of ACARS systems The engineering department at Aeronautical Radio Inc ARINC in an effort to reduce crew workload and improve data integrity introduced the ACARS system in July 1978 The first day of operations saw about 4000 transactions A few experimental ACARS systems were introduced earlier but ACARS did not start to get any widespread use by the major airlines until the 1980s The original ARINC development team was headed by Crawford Lane and included Betty Peck a programmer and Ralf Emory an engineer The terrestrial central site a pair of Honeywell Level 6 minicomputers and AFEPS software were developed by a subcontractor Eno Compton of ECOM IncAlthough the term ACARS is often understood as the data link avionics linereplaceable unit installed on aircraft the term actually refers to a complete air and ground system The original expansion of the abbreviation was Arinc Communications Addressing and Reporting System httpwwwarinccomdownloadsproductcollateralacarsfirstdatasheetpdf Later it was changed to Airline Communications Addressing and Reporting SystemOn the aircraft the ACARS system was made up of an avionics computer called an ACARS Management Unit MU and a Control Display Unit CDU The MU was designed to send and receive digital messages from the ground using existing VHF radiosOn the ground the ACARS system was made up of a network of radio transceivers managed by a central site computer called AFEPS Arinc Front End Processor System which received or transmitted the datalink messages as well as routed them to various airlines on the networkThe initial ACARS systems were designed to ARINC Characteristic 597 This was later upgraded in the late 1980s by the publication of ARINC Characteristic 724 ARINC 724 is intended for aircraft installed with avionics supporting digital data bus interfaces ARINC 724 was updated to the current standard ARINC Characteristic 724B which is the predominate standard for all digital aircraft With the introduction of ARINC 724B the ACARS MUs were also coupled with industry standard protocols for operation with flight management system MCDUs ARINC 739 and printers ARINC 740 and ARINC 744 The ACARS MU has been since expanded to serve broader needs using a   CM defined by ARINC Characteristic 758 Today new aircraft designs integrate CM functions in Integrated Modular Avionics IMA ARINC Standards are prepared by the Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee AEECOOOI eventsOne of the initial applications for ACARS was to automatically detect and report changes to the major flight phases Out of the gate Off the ground On the ground and Into the gate referred to in the industry as OOOI httpaspmhelpfaagovindexphpOOOIData These OOOI events are determined by algorithms that use aircraft sensors such as doors parking brake and strut switch sensors as inputs At the start of each flight phase a digital message is transmitted to the ground containing the flight phase the time at which it occurred and other related information such as amount of fuel on board or flight origin and destination These messages are used to track the status of aircraft and crews Flight management system interface In addition to detecting events on the aircraft and sending messages automatically to the ground initial systems were expanded to support new interfaces with other onboard avionics During the late 1980s and early 1990s a datalink interface between the ACARS MUs and  s FMS was introduced This interface enabled flight plans and weather information to be sent from the ground to the ACARS MU which would then be forwarded to the FMS This feature gave the airline the capability to update FMSs while in flight and allowed the flight crew to evaluate new weather conditions or alternative flight plans Maintenance data download The introduction in the early 1990s of the interface between the FDAMS    and the ACARS MU resulted in datalinks gaining wider acceptance by airlines The FDAMS    which analyze engine aircraft and operational performance conditions were now able to provide performance data to the airlines on the ground in real time using the ACARS network This reduced the need for airline personnel to go to the aircraft to offload the data from these systems These systems were capable of identifying abnormal flight conditions and automatically sending realtime messages to an airline Detailed engine reports could also be transmitted to the ground via ACARS The airlines used these reports to automate engine trending activities This capability enabled airlines to better monitor their engine performance and identify and plan repair and maintenance activitiesIn addition to the FMS and FDAMS interfaces the industry started to upgrade the onboard maintenance computers in the 1990s to support the transmission of maintenancerelated information in realtime through ACARS This enabled airline maintenance personnel to receive realtime data associated with maintenance faults on the aircraft When coupled with the FDAMS data airline maintenance personnel could now start planning repair and maintenance activities while the aircraft was still in flight Interactive crew interface All of the processing described above is performed automatically by the ACARS MU and other associated avionics systems without flight crew intervention As part of the growth of ACARS functionality the ACARS MUs also interfaced directly with a control display unit CDU located in the cockpit This CDU often referred to as an MCDU or MIDU provides the flight crew with the ability to send and receive messages similar to todays email To facilitate this communication the airlines in partnership with their ACARS vendor defined MCDU screens that could be presented to the flight crew and enable them to perform specific functions This feature provides the flight crew flexibility as to the types of information requested from the ground and the types of reports sent to the groundAs an example the flight crew could pull up an MCDU screen that allowed them to send to the ground a request for various types of weather information After the desired locations and type of weather information were entered ACARS transmitted this information to the ground In response to this request message ground computers sent the requested weather information back to the ACARS MU which was then displayed andor printedAirlines began adding new messages to support new applications weather winds clearances connecting flights etc and ACARS systems were customized to support airlineunique applications and unique ground computer requirements This resulted in each airline having its own unique ACARS application operating on its aircraft Some airlines have more than 75 MCDU screens for their flight crews where other may have only a dozen different screens In addition since each airlines ground computers were different the contents and formats of the messages sent by an ACARS MU were different for each airlineIn the wake of the crash of Air France Flight 447 there has been discussion about making ACARS an onlineblackbox OnlineBlackBox soll Crashs schneller aufklren SpiegelOnline June 6 2009 Accessed on June 6 2009 If such a system were in place it would avoid the loss of data due to 1 blackbox destruction and 2 inability to locate the blackbox following loss of the aircraft However the cost due to the high bandwidth requirements would be excessive and there have been very few incidents where the black boxes were not recoverable How it works A person or a system on board may create a message and send it via ACARS to a system or user on the ground and vice versa Messages may be sent either automatically or manually VHF subnetwork A network of VHF ground radio stations ensure that aircraft can communicate with ground end systems in realtime from practically anywhere in the world VHF communication is lineofsight and provides communication with groundbased transceivers often referred to as Remote Ground Stations or RGSs The typical range is dependent on altitude with a 200mile transmission range common at high altitudes Thus VHF communication is only applicable over landmasses which have a VHF ground network installed A typical ACARS VHF transmission  Mode A  Aircraft B18722  Ack NAK  Block id 2  Flight CI5118  Label B9  Msg No L05A  Message KLAXTI2024KLAXA91A1  SATCOM and HF subnetworks SATCOM can provide worldwide coverage Depending on the satellite system in use coverage may be limited or absent at high latitudes such as needed for flights over the poles HF datalink is a relatively new network whose installation began in 1995 and was completed in 2001 Aircraft with HF or global SATCOM datalink can fly polar routes and maintain communication with ground based systems ATC centers and airline operation centers ARINC is the only service provider for HF datalink Datalink message types ACARS messages may be of three types Air Traffic Control ATC Aeronautical Operational Control AOC Airline Administrative Control AACATC messages are used to communicate between the aircraft and Air Traffic Control These messages are defined in ARINC Standard 623 ATC messages are used by aircraft crew to request clearances and by ground controllers to provide those clearancesAOC and AAC messages are used to communicate between the aircraft and its base These messages are either standardized according to ARINC Standard 633 or defined by the users but in the latter case they must meet at least the guidelines of ARINC Standard 618 Various types of messages are possible for example relating to fuel consumption engine performance data aircraft position in addition to free text  Example transmissions  Departure delay downlink A pilot wants to inform his flight operations department that departure has been delayed by Air Traffic Control The pilot loads a CMU MCDU screen that allows him to enter the expected length of and reason for the delay After entering the information on the MCDU he depresses a SEND key on the MCDU The CMU detects that the SEND key was pushed and then generates a digital message containing the delay information This message may include such information as aircraft registration number the origination and destination airport codes the current Estimated Time of Arrival ETA before the delay and the current expected duration of the delay The CMU then sends the message to an existing radio HF SATCOM or VHF with the selection of the radio based on special logic contained within the CMU For a message to be sent over the VHF network the radio transmits the VHF signals containing the delay message which is then received by a VHF Remote Ground Station RGSMost ACARS messages are only 100 to 200 characters in length Such messages are made up of a oneblock transmission from or to the aircraft One ACARS block is constrained to be no more than 220 characters within the body of the message For downlink messages which are longer than 220 characters the ACARS unit splits the message into multiple blocks transmitting each block to the RGS there is a constraint that no message may be made up of more than 16 blocks The RGS collects each block of such multiblock messages until the complete message is received before processing and routing the message ACARS also contains protocols to support a retry of failed messages or retransmission of messages whenever the service provider changesOnce the RGS receives the complete message the RGS forwards the message to the datalink service providers DSP main computer system The DSP ground network uses landlines to link the RGS to the DSP The DSP uses information contained in their routing table to forward the message to the airlines or other destinations This table is maintained by the DSP and identifies each aircraft by tail number and the types of messages that it can process Each airline must tell its service providers what messages and message labels their ACARS systems will send and for each message where they want the service provider to route the message The service provider then updates their routing tables from this information Each type of message sent by the CMU has a specific message label which is contained in the header information of the message Using the label contained in the message the DSP looks up the message in the table and forwards it to the airlines computer system which then processes messageThis processing performed by an airline may include reformatting the message populating databases for later analysis or forwarding the message to other departments such as flight operations maintenance engineering finance or other organizations within an airline In the example of a delay message it may be routed via the airlines network to both their operations department as well as to a facility at the aircrafts destination notifying them of a potential late arrivalThe elapsed transmission time from the moment the flight crew presses the send key to the moment it is processed by an airlines computer system varies but is generally on the order of 6 to 15 seconds The messages that are sent to the ground from the CMU are referred to as downlink messages Weather report uplink For a message to be transmitted to the aircraft referred to as an uplink message the process is nearly a mirror image of how a downlink is sent from the aircraft For example in response to an ACARS downlink message requesting weather information a weather report is constructed by the airlines computer system The message contains the aircraft registration number in the header of the message with the body of the message containing the actual weather information This message is sent to the DSPs main computer systemThe DSP transmits the message over their ground network to a VHF remote ground station in the vicinity of the aircraft The remote ground station broadcasts the message over the VHF The onboard VHF radio receives the VHF signal and passes the message to the CMU with the internal modem transforming the signal into a digital message The CMU validates the aircraft registration number and processes the messageThe processing performed on the uplink message by the CMU depends on the specific airline requirements In general an uplink is either forwarded to another avionics computer such as an FMS or FDAMS or is processed by the CMU For messages destined for the CMU such as a weather report uplink the flight crew refers to a specific MCDU screen which contains a list of all received uplink messages The flight crew then selects the weather message for viewing on the MCDU The ACARS unit may also print the message on the cockpit printer either automatically upon receiving the message or in response to the flight crews pressing a PRINT prompt on the MCDU screen FDAMS message downlink Messages are sent to the ground from other onboard systems in a manner similar to the delay message example discussed above As an example an FDAMS system may have a series of active algorithms monitoring engine exceedance conditions during flight such as checking whether engine vibration or oil temperature exceeds normal operating conditions Upon detecting such an event the FDAMS system automatically creates an engine exceedance condition message with applicable data contained within the body of the message The message is forwarded to the CMU using what is referred to as ARINC 619 data protocols The CMU then transmits the message to the ground In this case the service providers routing table for an engine exceedance message is typically defined to have the message routed directly to an airlines maintenance department This enables airline maintenance personnel to be notified of a potential problem in real timeThere are three major components to the ACARS datalink system Aircraft equipment Service provider Ground processing system Aircraft equipment The heart of the datalink system on board the aircraft is the ACARS Management Unit MU The older version of MU is defined in ARINC Characteristic 724B Newer versions are referred to as the   CMU and are defined in ARINC Characteristic 758 Aircraft equipment consists of airborne end systems and a router End systems are the source of ACARS downlinks and the destination for uplinks The MUCMU is the router Its function is to route a downlink by means of the most efficient airground subnetwork In many cases the MUCMU also acts as an end system for AOC messagesTypical airborne end systems are the   FMS datalink printer maintenance computer and cabin terminal Typical datalink functions are FMS  sends flight plan change requests position reports etc Receives clearances and controller instructions Printer  as an end system can be addressed from the ground to automatically print an uplink message Maintenance computer  downlinks diagnostic messages In advanced systems inflight troubleshooting can be conducted by technicians on the ground by using datalink messages to command diagnostic routines in the maintenance computer and analyzing downlinked results Cabin terminal  Often used by flight attendants to communicate special passenger needs gate changes due to delays catering etcACARS messages are transmitted over one of three airground subnetworks VHF is the most commonly used and least expensive Transmission is lineofsight so VHF is not available over the oceans or other vast expansions of uninhabited surface such as the Amazon Basin SATCOM is a fairly expensive service that provides near worldwide coverage The Inmarsat satellite network does not cover the polar regions The Iridium satellite network became usable for ACARS transport in 2007 and provides excellent coverage in the polar regions HF is a more recently established subnetwork Its purpose is to provide coverage in the polar regions where Inmarsat coverage is unreliableThe router function built into the MUCMU determines which subnetwork to use when routing a message from the aircraft to the ground The airline operator provides a routing table that the CMU uses to select the best subnetwork Datalink service provider The role of the datalink service provider DSP is to deliver a message from the aircraft to the ground end system and vice versaBecause the ACARS network is modeled after the pointtopoint telex network all messages come to a central processing location The DSP routes the message to the appropriate end system using its network of land lines and ground stations Before the days of computers messages came to the central processing location and were punched on paper tape The tape was then physically carried to the machine connected to the intended destination Today the routing function is done by computer but the model remains the sameThere are currently two primary service providers of ground networks in the world ARINC and SITA although specific countries have implemented their own network with the help of either ARINC or SITA ARINC operates a worldwide network and has also assisted the Civil Aviation Administration of China CAAC as well as Thailand and South America with the installation of VHF networks SITA has operated the network in Europe Middle East South America and Asia for many years They have also recently started a network in the USA to compete with ARINCUntil recently each area of the world was supported by a single service provider This is changing and both ARINC and SITA are competing and installing networks that cover the same regions Ground end system The ground end system is the destination for downlinks and the source of uplinks Generally ground end systems are either government agencies such as CAAFAA an airline operations headquarters or in the case of small airlines or general aviation consumers a subscription based solution CAA end systems provide air traffic services such as clearances Airline and general aviation operations provide information

Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System ACARS is a digital datalink system for transmission of short relatively simple messages between aircraft and ground stations via radio or satellite The protocol which was designed by Aeronautical Radio Incorporated ARINC to replace their very high frequency VHF voice service and deployed in 1978 uses telex formats SITA later augmented their worldwide ground data network by adding radio stations to provide ACARS service Over the next 20 years ACARS will be superseded by the   ATN protocol for Air Traffic Control communications and by the Internet Protocol for airline communications History of ACARS Prior to the introduction of datalink all communication between the aircraft ie the flight crew and personnel on the ground was performed using voice communication This communication used either VHF or HF voice radios which was further augmented with SATCOM in the early 1990s In many cases the voicerelayed information involved dedicated radio operators and digital messages sent to an airline teletype system or its successor systems Introduction of ACARS systems The engineering department at Aeronautical Radio Inc ARINC in an effort to reduce crew workload and improve data integrity introduced the ACARS system in July 1978 The first day of operations saw about 4000 transactions A few experimental ACARS systems were introduced earlier but ACARS did not start to get any widespread use by the major airlines until the 1980s The original ARINC development team was headed by Crawford Lane and included Betty Peck a programmer and Ralf Emory an engineer The terrestrial central site a pair of Honeywell Level 6 minicomputers and AFEPS software were developed by a subcontractor Eno Compton of ECOM IncAlthough the term ACARS is often understood as the data link avionics linereplaceable unit installed on aircraft the term actually refers to a complete air and ground system The original expansion of the abbreviation was Arinc Communications Addressing and Reporting System httpwwwarinccomdownloadsproductcollateralacarsfirstdatasheetpdf Later it was changed to Airline Communications Addressing and Reporting SystemOn the aircraft the ACARS system was made up of an avionics computer called an ACARS Management Unit MU and a Control Display Unit CDU The MU was designed to send and receive digital messages from the ground using existing VHF radiosOn the ground the ACARS system was made up of a network of radio transceivers managed by a central site computer called AFEPS Arinc Front End Processor System which received or transmitted the datalink messages as well as routed them to various airlines on the networkThe initial ACARS systems were designed to ARINC Characteristic 597 This was later upgraded in the late 1980s by the publication of ARINC Characteristic 724 ARINC 724 is intended for aircraft installed with avionics supporting digital data bus interfaces ARINC 724 was updated to the current standard ARINC Characteristic 724B which is the predominate standard for all digital aircraft With the introduction of ARINC 724B the ACARS MUs were also coupled with industry standard protocols for operation with flight management system MCDUs ARINC 739 and printers ARINC 740 and ARINC 744 The ACARS MU has been since expanded to serve broader needs using a   CM defined by ARINC Characteristic 758 Today new aircraft designs integrate CM functions in Integrated Modular Avionics IMA ARINC Standards are prepared by the Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee AEECOOOI eventsOne of the initial applications for ACARS was to automatically detect and report changes to the major flight phases Out of the gate Off the ground On the ground and Into the gate referred to in the industry as OOOI httpaspmhelpfaagovindexphpOOOIData These OOOI events are determined by algorithms that use aircraft sensors such as doors parking brake and strut switch sensors as inputs At the start of each flight phase a digital message is transmitted to the ground containing the flight phase the time at which it occurred and other related information such as amount of fuel on board or flight origin and destination These messages are used to track the status of aircraft and crews Flight management system interface In addition to detecting events on the aircraft and sending messages automatically to the ground initial systems were expanded to support new interfaces with other onboard avionics During the late 1980s and early 1990s a datalink interface between the ACARS MUs and  s FMS was introduced This interface enabled flight plans and weather information to be sent from the ground to the ACARS MU which would then be forwarded to the FMS This feature gave the airline the capability to update FMSs while in flight and allowed the flight crew to evaluate new weather conditions or alternative flight plans Maintenance data download The introduction in the early 1990s of the interface between the FDAMS    and the ACARS MU resulted in datalinks gaining wider acceptance by airlines The FDAMS    which analyze engine aircraft and operational performance conditions were now able to provide performance data to the airlines on the ground in real time using the ACARS network This reduced the need for airline personnel to go to the aircraft to offload the data from these systems These systems were capable of identifying abnormal flight conditions and automatically sending realtime messages to an airline Detailed engine reports could also be transmitted to the ground via ACARS The airlines used these reports to automate engine trending activities This capability enabled airlines to better monitor their engine performance and identify and plan repair and maintenance activitiesIn addition to the FMS and FDAMS interfaces the industry started to upgrade the onboard maintenance computers in the 1990s to support the transmission of maintenancerelated information in realtime through ACARS This enabled airline maintenance personnel to receive realtime data associated with maintenance faults on the aircraft When coupled with the FDAMS data airline maintenance personnel could now start planning repair and maintenance activities while the aircraft was still in flight Interactive crew interface All of the processing described above is performed automatically by the ACARS MU and other associated avionics systems without flight crew intervention As part of the growth of ACARS functionality the ACARS MUs also interfaced directly with a control display unit CDU located in the cockpit This CDU often referred to as an MCDU or MIDU provides the flight crew with the ability to send and receive messages similar to todays email To facilitate this communication the airlines in partnership with their ACARS vendor defined MCDU screens that could be presented to the flight crew and enable them to perform specific functions This feature provides the flight crew flexibility as to the types of information requested from the ground and the types of reports sent to the groundAs an example the flight crew could pull up an MCDU screen that allowed them to send to the ground a request for various types of weather information After the desired locations and type of weather information were entered ACARS transmitted this information to the ground In response to this request message ground computers sent the requested weather information back to the ACARS MU which was then displayed andor printedAirlines began adding new messages to support new applications weather winds clearances connecting flights etc and ACARS systems were customized to support airlineunique applications and unique ground computer requirements This resulted in each airline having its own unique ACARS application operating on its aircraft Some airlines have more than 75 MCDU screens for their flight crews where other may have only a dozen different screens In addition since each airlines ground computers were different the contents and formats of the messages sent by an ACARS MU were different for each airlineIn the wake of the crash of Air France Flight 447 there has been discussion about making ACARS an onlineblackbox OnlineBlackBox soll Crashs schneller aufklren SpiegelOnline June 6 2009 Accessed on June 6 2009 If such a system were in place it would avoid the loss of data due to 1 blackbox destruction and 2 inability to locate the blackbox following loss of the aircraft However the cost due to the high bandwidth requirements would be excessive and there have been very few incidents where the black boxes were not recoverable How it works A person or a system on board may create a message and send it via ACARS to a system or user on the ground and vice versa Messages may be sent either automatically or manually VHF subnetwork A network of VHF ground radio stations ensure that aircraft can communicate with ground end systems in realtime from practically anywhere in the world VHF communication is lineofsight and provides communication with groundbased transceivers often referred to as Remote Ground Stations or RGSs The typical range is dependent on altitude with a 200mile transmission range common at high altitudes Thus VHF communication is only applicable over landmasses which have a VHF ground network installed A

coverage Depending on the satellite system in use coverage may be limited or absent at high latitudes such as needed for flights over the poles HF datalink is a relatively new network whose installation began in 1995 and was completed in 2001 Aircraft with HF or global SATCOM datalink can fly polar routes and maintain communication with ground based systems ATC centers and airline operation centers ARINC is the only service provider for HF datalink Datalink message types ACARS messages may be of three types Air Traffic Control ATC Aeronautical Operational Control AOC Airline Administrative Control AACATC messages are used to communicate between the aircraft and Air Traffic Control These messages are defined in ARINC Standard 623 ATC messages are used by aircraft crew to request clearances and by ground controllers to provide those clearancesAOC and AAC messages are used to communicate between the aircraft and its base These messages are either standardized according to ARINC Standard 633 or defined by the users but in the latter case they must meet at least the guidelines of ARINC Standard 618 Various types of messages are possible for example relating to fuel consumption engine performance data aircraft position in addition to free text  Example transmissions  Departure delay downlink A pilot wants to inform his flight operations department that departure has been delayed by Air Traffic Control The pilot loads a CMU MCDU screen that allows him to enter the expected length of and reason for the delay After entering the information on the MCDU he depresses a SEND key on the MCDU The CMU detects that the SEND key was pushed and then generates a digital message containing the delay information This message may include such information as aircraft registration number the origination and destination airport codes the current Estimated Time of Arrival ETA before the delay and the current expected duration of the delay The CMU then sends the message to an existing radio HF SATCOM or VHF with the selection of the radio based on special logic contained within the CMU For a message to be sent over the VHF network the radio transmits the VHF signals containing the delay message which is then received by a VHF Remote Ground Station RGSMost ACARS messages are only 100 to 200 characters in length Such messages are made up of a oneblock transmission from or to the aircraft One ACARS block is constrained to be no more than 220 characters within the body of the message For downlink messages which are longer than 220 characters the ACARS unit splits the message into multiple blocks transmitting each block to the RGS there is a constraint that no message may be made up of more than 16 blocks The RGS collects each block of such multiblock messages until the complete message is received before processing and routing the message ACARS also contains protocols to support a retry of failed messages or retransmission of messages whenever the service provider changesOnce the RGS receives the complete message the RGS forwards the message to the datalink service providers DSP main computer system The DSP ground network uses landlines to link the RGS to the DSP The DSP uses information contained in their routing table to forward the message to the airlines or other destinations This table is maintained by the DSP and identifies each aircraft by tail number and the types of messages that it can process Each airline must tell its service providers what messages and message labels their ACARS systems will send and for each message where they want the service provider to route the message The service provider then updates their routing tables from this information Each type of message sent by the CMU has a specific message label which is contained in the header information of the message Using the label contained in the message the DSP looks up the message in the table and forwards it to the airlines computer system which then processes messageThis processing performed by an airline may include reformatting the message populating databases for later analysis or forwarding the message to other departments such as flight operations maintenance engineering finance or other organizations within an airline In the example of a delay message it may be routed via the airlines network to both their operations department as well as to a facility at the aircrafts destination notifying them of a potential late arrivalThe elapsed transmission time from the moment the flight crew presses the send key to the moment it is processed by an airlines computer system varies but is generally on the order of 6 to 15 seconds The messages that are sent to the ground from the CMU are referred to as downlink

messages destined for the CMU such as a weather report uplink the flight crew refers to a specific MCDU screen which contains a list of all received uplink messages The flight crew then selects the weather message for viewing on the MCDU The ACARS unit may also print the message on the cockpit printer either automatically upon receiving the message or in response to the flight crews pressing a PRINT prompt on the MCDU screen FDAMS message downlink Messages are sent to the ground from other onboard systems in a manner similar to the delay message example discussed above As an example an FDAMS system may have a series of active algorithms monitoring engine exceedance conditions during flight such as checking whether engine vibration or oil temperature exceeds normal operating

defining future growth phases for the CMU Initial CMU systems which perform todays ACARS functions are classified as Level OA  ARINC 823 Twopart specification that defines a security framework for protecting ACARS datalink messages exchanged between aircraft and ground systems Security services include confidentiality data integrity and message authentication Part 1   AMS specifies the security protocol and Part 2 Key Management specifies lifecycle management of the cryptographic keys necessary for secure and proper operation of AMS  ARINC documents and their specifications  Acronyms and glossary It has been rumored that the introduction of datalink into the airline industry originated as part of a contest to see how many acronyms could be developed around a specific technology Whether this is true or not the industry is at the point where acronyms are now nested within acronyms For example AOA is an acronym for   where AVLC itself is an acronym for   and VHF is also an acronym for  ACARS     Aircraft Condition Monitoring SystemAMS    as specified in ARINC 823AOA    With the introduction of VDL Mode 2 the ACARS protocols were modified to take advantage of the higher data rate made possible by Mode 2 AOA is an interim step in replacing the ACARS protocols with ATN protocolsATN    As air traffic increases ACARS will no longer have the capacity or flexibility to handle the large number of datalink communications ATN is planned to replace ACARS in the future and will provide services such as authentication security and a true internetworking architecture Europe is leading the US in the implementation of ATNAVLC    A particular protocol used for aeronautical datalink communicationsCDU     Communications Management Function The software that runs in a CMU and sometimes as a software partition in an integrated avionics computerCMU    Successor to the MU the CMU performs similar datalink routing functions but has additional capacity to support more functions CMU standards are defined in ARINC Characteristic 758FDAMS       FMS standards are defined in ARINC Characteristic 702 and 702AHFDL    is an ACARS communications media used to exchange data such as Airline Operational Control AOC messages Controller Pilot Data Link Communication CPDLC messages and Automatic Dependent Surveillance ADS messages between aircraft endsystems and corresponding groundbased HFDL ground stationsHF  High Frequency A portion of the RF spectrumLRU    An avionics black box that can be replaced on the flight line without downing the aircraft for maintenanceMCDU    A textonly device that displays messages to the aircrew and accepts crew input on an integrated keyboard MCDU standards are defined in ARINC Characteristic 739 MCDUs have seven input ports and can be used with seven different systems such as CMU or FMS Each system connected to an MCDU generates its own display pages and accepts keyboard input when it is selected as the system controlling the

Apache Incubator is the gateway for opensource projects intended to become fully fledged Apache Software Foundation projectsThe Incubator project was created in October 2002 to provide an entry path to the Apache Software Foundation for projects and codebases wishing to become part of the Foundations efforts All code donations from external organizations and existing external projects wishing to move to Apache must enter through the IncubatorThe Apache Incubator project serves on the one hand as a temporary container project until the incubating project is accepted and becomes a toplevel project of the Apache Software Foundation or becomes subproject of a proper project such as the Jakarta Project or Apache XML On the other hand the Incubator project documents how the Foundation works and how to get things done within its framework This means documenting process roles and policies within the Apache Software Foundation and its member projectsCurrent Subprojects Ambari Ambari is a

This list of Singapore abbreviations sets out abbreviations that are commonly used in SingaporeOverviewAbbreviations are of three basic kinds Clippings in which a shortened form of a word occurs Common clippings in Singapore are aircon from airconditioner condo from condominium sabo from sabotage Brown Singapore English in a Nutshell above p 187 and cert from certificate  Acronyms in which the initial letters are formed into a single word such as scuba which is derived from selfcontained underwater breathing apparatus Creation of acronyms such as this is rare in Singapore English though TIBS    and CISCO    are found Brown Singapore English in a Nutshell above p 112  Initialisms in which the individual letters are spelled out This is by far the most common category in Singapore including PAP Peoples Action Party and PIE PanIsland Expressway which are pronounced and respectively and never and  Some analysts regard initialisms such as these as one kind of acronym Low  Brown English in Singapore above p 70 but others prefer to distinguish between the two categories Deterding Singapore English above p 77 Initialisms are extremely common in Singapore and many have become better known and more widely used than the full form of the words they represent One example is the Kandang Kerbau Womens and Childrens Hospital which is more commonly referred to as KKThe most important category of Singapore initialisms are those for government departments and public institutions Among the earliest examples are PUB Public Utilities Board and HDB   Abbreviations such as these were especially important in the past when most Singaporeans were not educated in English and their use facilitated communication in the public services where the main administrative language is English Government departments have therefore promoted the use of these initialisms so they occur even in nonEnglish publications Although the younger generation of Singaporeans are now all educated in English abbreviations remain a major characteristic of Singapore EnglishThere are efforts to maintain some consistency among the initialisms Three letters are used for government institutions PUB HDB CPF MOH CWO and for expressways AYE PIE KJE while two letters are used for polytechnics SP RP To maintain this consistency some abbreviations are not direct initials for example CTE is used for   instead of CE and NP is used for Ngee Ann Polytechnic instead of NAP When the   NTU was established in 1991 the name was chosen instead of the alternative Nanyang University of Technology because the latter would have resulted in the unsuitable NUT While Anderson Secondary School has shortened its name to ANDSS instead of ASSRecently there have emerged a number of unconventional abbreviations such as AStar for Agency for Science Technology and Research When SAFTI   Training Institute was reorganised in 1995 it acquired the name SAFTI Military Institute further abbreviated as SAFTI MI which when fully expanded would form a rather awkward title   Training Institute Military InstituteAbbreviations09 4D  4Digits a Singapore lottery 5 Cs  5 Cs of Singapore Cash Car Credit card Condominium Country

This list of Singapore abbreviations sets out abbreviations that are commonly used in SingaporeOverviewAbbreviations are of three basic kinds Clippings in which a shortened form of a word occurs Common clippings in Singapore are aircon from airconditioner condo from condominium sabo from sabotage Brown Singapore English in a Nutshell above p 187 and cert from certificate  Acronyms in which the initial letters are formed into a single word such as scuba which is derived from selfcontained underwater breathing apparatus Creation of acronyms such as this is rare in Singapore English though TIBS    and CISCO    are found Brown Singapore English in a Nutshell above p 112  Initialisms in which the individual letters are spelled out This is by far the most common category in Singapore including PAP Peoples Action Party and PIE PanIsland Expressway which are pronounced and respectively and never and  Some analysts regard initialisms such as these as one kind of acronym Low  Brown English in Singapore above p 70 but others prefer to distinguish between the two categories Deterding Singapore English above p 77 Initialisms are extremely common in Singapore and many have become better known and more widely used than the full form of the words they represent One example is the Kandang Kerbau Womens and Childrens Hospital which is more commonly referred to as KKThe most important category of Singapore initialisms are those for government departments and public institutions Among the earliest examples are PUB Public Utilities Board and HDB   Abbreviations such as these were especially important in the past when most Singaporeans were not educated in English and their use facilitated communication in the public services where the main administrative language is English Government departments have therefore promoted the use of these initialisms so they occur even in nonEnglish publications Although the younger generation of Singaporeans are now all educated in English abbreviations remain a major characteristic of Singapore EnglishThere are efforts to maintain some consistency among the initialisms Three letters are used for government institutions PUB HDB CPF MOH CWO and for expressways AYE PIE KJE while two letters are used for polytechnics SP RP To maintain this consistency some abbreviations are not direct initials for example CTE is used for   instead of CE and NP is used for Ngee Ann Polytechnic instead of NAP When the   NTU was established in 1991 the name was chosen instead of the alternative Nanyang University of Technology because the latter would have resulted in the unsuitable NUT While Anderson Secondary School has shortened its name to ANDSS instead of ASSRecently there have emerged a number of unconventional abbreviations such as AStar for Agency for Science Technology and Research When SAFTI   Training Institute was reorganised in 1995 it acquired the name SAFTI Military Institute further abbreviated as SAFTI MI which when fully expanded would form a rather awkward title   Training Institute Military InstituteAbbreviations09 4D  4Digits a Singapore lottery 5 Cs  5 Cs of Singapore Cash Car Credit card Condominium Country

The Basque National Party  EAJ  PNV  PNB is the largest and oldest Basque nationalist party It is currently the largest political party in the Basque Autonomous Community especially in the Biscay province also with a minor presence in Navarre where is a member of the coalition Geroa Bai formerly named Nafarroa Bai and a marginal one in the French Basque Country The party has led the Basque regional government for a long period spanning since the devolution of Basque autonomy in the early 1980s until 2009 It has also played an important role in the Spanish Congress along other regional nationalist partiesIn Basque it is called Euzko Alderdi Jeltzalea EAJ literally meaning Basque Party of Supporters of God and Old Laws or Fuero and in Spanish it is called the Partido Nacionalista Vasco PNV In Spain it is commonly referred to as PNV whereas its French branch is the Parti Nationaliste Basque EAJPNB The party typically refers to itself as EAJPNV The current chairman of EAJPNV is Iigo Urkullu The youth wing of the Basque Nationalist Party is called EGI Euzko Gaztedi Indarra Basque Youth ForceThe party also has offices among the Basque diaspora mainly in Venezuela Argentina Mexico Uruguay Chile and the United States Origins and early history In 1898 the party opened its second batzoki meeting place a club and bar in BarakaldoThe party was founded in 1895 by Sabino de Arana Goiri as a Catholic conservative party agitating for the restoration of selfgovernment and the defense of the Basque race Currently it describes itself as Basque democratic participatory plural and humanist It is a moderate nationalist party which favours greater autonomy for the Basque nation EAJPNV opposes political violenceIn its beginnings the party established a requirement for its members to prove Basque ancestry by having a minimum number of Basque surnamesIn 1921 the Arana movement split into the traditionalist Comunin Nacionalista Vasca Basque Nationalist Communion and the independentist Aberri HomelandDuring the single party dictatorship rule of general Miguel Primo de Rivera the nationalist parties were outlawed and persecutedHowever its activity continued under the guise of mountain mendigoizale and folklore clubsAt the end of 1930 Aberri and CNV reunited under the old name of EAJPNVHowever a small group formed Accin Nacionalista Vasca Basque Nationalist ActionIt was on the moderate nationalist left nonconfessional and open to alliances with the republican and socialist parties fighting against the dictatorship The Second Spanish Republic PNV sticker Text Euzkadik bear zaitu Euzkadi needs you It is inspired by Alfred Leetes British poster for Kitcheners Army 19341935 The division between autonomism and independentism appeared again during the second Spanish Republic Headed by Eli Gallastegi a small group of radical independentists gathered around the weekly JagiJagi and the Mountaineer Federation of Biscay left the party They rejected the autonomy that PNV was working for The Spanish civil war and Francos rule Civil WarAfter the coup dtat of 18 July 1936 the party felt torn It shared the rebel sides Catholicism and there was pressure from the Vatican to keep away from the Republic but the promised autonomy and their antiFascist ideology led them to side with the republican government The Biscayne and Guipuzcoan branches the more important in number declared support for the Republic Democracy and antiFascism in the ensuing Spanish Civil War and were key in balancing those provinces to the Republican side In the territory seized by the rebels PNV members faced tough times Some members of the Alavese and Navarrese committees without an official decision published notes refusing support to the Republic Some nationalists could flee to France or the Republican area Some faced the rebel forces ending in prison or shot Some joined the Carlist battalions either out of conviction or to avoid attacks The repression was focused on leftists but nationalists were also targeted The party premises and press were closed in that month of JulyInitially the Defence Committees in Biscay and Guipuzcoa were dominated by the Popular Front Although with enough difficulties Basque autonomy was granted within the Second Spanish Republic and the new Basque Government immediately organized the Basque Army consisting of militias recruited by each of the political organizations including PNVJos Antonio Aguirre the party leader became in October 1936 the first lendakari Basque president of the wartime multipartite Basque Government ruling the unconquered parts of Biscay and Guipuzcoa When Bilbao the most populated town in the Basque Country was taken by Francos troops the Basque nationalists decided to keep untouched all the heavy industries of Bilbao dedicated to iron and machinery thinking that they had the responsibility of securing the prosperity of their people in the future This decision made available to the fascist rebels that important industryOn April 1937 the city of Guernica was bombed by German airplanes The president of the basque autonomous republic party named Jose Antonio de Aguirre stated The German planes bombed us with a brutality that had never been seen before for two and a half hours A famous spanish painter named Pablo Picasso made a painting in remembrance of the massacre named after the city that year In July 1937 having lost all the Basque territory the Basque army retreated towards Santander Out of their land and without help from the Republic the Basque Army surrendered to the Italian Corpo Truppe Volontari through the socalled Santoa Agreement The heads of the EAJPNV stayed with the soldiers to follow their mens same fate Prison and executions ordered by the fascists followed The Basque government in exile then moved to Barcelona until the fall of Catalonia and then out of Spain to the exile first to France where they organized the camps and services with the president heading it personally Aguirre was in Belgium when Hitler occupied that country and so he started a long travel to Berlin under a false identityUnder the protection of a Panamanian ambassador Aguirre got to reach Sweden and dodging the SS German intelligence he arrived to Brazil and Uruguay where his dignity was reinstated and given visa to New York where he established under the protection of AmericanBasques as teacher of Columbia UniversityExile during the postwar The president of the Basque Government in exile was always a PNV member and even the sole Spanish representative in the United Nations was the Basque appointee Jess de Galndez until his murder in an obscure episode regarding his PhD Thesis about Dominican Republics dictator Trujillo He also decided to put the large Basque exiles network at the service of the Allied side and collaborated with the US Secretary of State and the CIA during the Cold War to fight Communism in Spanish AmericaWhen the United States decided to back Franco in 1952 Aguirre went to France anew where the Basque Government in exile was established Also he learned there that the proNazi French government of Vichy confiscated the Basque Governments building and that the antiNazi De Gaulle maintained it as a Spanish Governments possession given that the Basque Government has never had any international consideration other than representatives of a region in Spain at most The building today is the Instituto Cervantes premises where French people can learn any of the Spanish languages including BasqueGenerational conflict and new alliancesIn 1959 ETA was created by young undergraduates from the area of Bilbao organization EKIN lured by Basque nationalist ideology but increasingly disgruntled at the ineffective political action of the PNV largely daunted by afterwar repression and scattered in exile In addition the new generation resented an attempt of PNV to pull the strings of their movement and PNVs youth wing Euzko Gaztedi EGI with whom they had merged in the mid50s as well as showing a more modern stance stressing for one the language as the centre of Basqueness instead of raceIn the 1950s and 60s the party looked for alliances abroad expecting at first that the defeat of the Axis in World War II would encourage USAs support for an eventual overthrow of Francos hold on power which didnt happen In addition it was a founder party of the Christian Democrat International but now the party is an active member of the European Democratic Party with the French Union pour la Dmocratie Franaise etcIn the late 60s and early 70s contacts started with other Spanish parties to assert PNVs position in a new postFrancoist order At the same time the Basque Nationalist Party confirmed its stance against ETA in a period when its violent actions saw a surge and its influence in society was very apparent especially in street protests Juan de Ajuriaguerra paved the way for PNVs comeback to Basque politics from exile and started to negotiate their participation in the new statusquo with special attention to a new StatuteA Basque StatutePNVs good results in 1977 and 1978 confirmed PNVs central position in Basque politics While PNV advocated for abstention in the referendum on the Spanish Constitution for its lack of Basque input the party supported the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country approved in December 1978 and paved the way to its success in the first elections held in the Basque Autonomous Community once Navarre was left outIn the transition years after Francos death in 1975 Xabier Arzallus came to prominence who masterminded the socalled Spirit of Arriaga to accommodate the party to the new Spanish democracy Despite some internal tensions the former priest and Jesuit came up reinforced and was chosen undisputed party leader PNV found in Biscay its main and strongest support base while in Navarre PNV was next to nonexistent Carlos Garaikoetxea spearheaded the new autonomous government after being elected with 388 of the votes and during this first term the Basque Nationalist Party held office without outside support During this period PNVs challenges were closely associated to its position in the Basque Government defense of the Statute devolution of powers from Madrid discrediting of political violence restructuring of manufacturing industry steeped in crisisAs of 1985 tensions inside the party spurred the formation of a splinter group with a stronghold in Gipuzkoa which in turn led to a new party in 1987 when dissenters from the PNV formed Eusko Alkartasuna Basque Solidarity Carlos Garaikoetxea was then elected as the first president of the rival party The split from the PNV was mainly based on A personality clash between the lehendakari Garaikoetxea who went to form Eusko Alkartasuna EA and the PNV leader Xabier Arzalluz The configuration of the Basque Country A strong Basque government and weak provinces EA Strong provinces PNVAfterwards some ideological differences also came out EA adopted a socialdemocratic ideology while the PNV remained more attached to its Christiandemocratic ideas The split was particularly bitter given that it was headed by the lehendakari premier himself Many PNV political bars batzoki meeting place became alkartetxe meeting houseSince 1991 as time has eased the bitter split helped by the fact that both Arzalluz and Garaikoetxea have gone into political retirement both parties agreed to form an electoral coalition in a number of local elections as a means to maximize the nationalist votes which eventually led to reunite both candidatures in a joint list again for the regional governments of Navarra and the Basque Autonomous Community in 1998 Thus EA has participated in several PNVled Basque governments including the 2006 government of President Juan Jos Ibarretxe Markuartu Still EA decided to run by itself in the municipal elections held in May 2007Until its election defeat in 2009 PNV dominated every administration of the Basque government In Navarre EA and PNV formed the coalition Nafarroa Bai along with Aralar and Batzarre The PNV has

In computer architecture     or IPC is one aspect of a processors performance the average number of instructions executed for each clock cycle It is the multiplicative inverse of cycles per instruction John L Hennessy David A Patterson Andrea C ArpaciDusseau Computer architecture a quantitative approach 2007  Explanation  Calculation of IPC The number of instructions per second for a processor can be derived by multiplying the instructions per cycle and the clock speed measured in cycles per second or Hertz of the processor in question The number of instructions per second is an approximate indicator of the likely performance of the processorThe number of instructions executed per clock is not a constant for a given processor it depends on how the particular software being run interacts with the processor and indeed the entire machine particularly the memory hierarchy However certain processor features tend to lead to designs that have higherthanaverage IPC values the presence of multiple arithmetic logic units an ALU is a processor subsystem that can perform elementary arithmetic and logical operations and short pipelines When comparing different instruction sets a simpler instruction set may lead to a higher IPC figure than an implementation of a more complex instruction set using the same chip technology however the more complex instruction set may be able to achieve more useful work with fewer instructions Factors governing IPC A given level of instructions per second can be achieved with a high IPC and a low clock speed like the AMD Athlon and Intel Core 2 or from a low IPC and high clock speed like the Intel Pentium 4 and to a lesser extent the AMD Bulldozer microarchitecture Both are valid processor designs and the choice between the two is often dictated by history engineering constraints or marketing pressures Computer speed The useful work that can be done with any computer depends on many factors besides the processor speed These factors include the processor architecture the internal layout of the machine the speed of the disk storage system the speed of other attached devices the efficiency of the operating system and most importantly the high level design of the application software in useFor users and purchasers of a computer system   is not a particularly useful indication of the performance of their system For an accurate measure of performance relevant to them application benchmarks are much more useful Awareness of its existence is useful in that it provides an easytograsp example of why clock speed is not the only factor relevant to computer performance See also  Cycles per instruction Megahertz myth The benchmark article provides a useful introduction to computer performance measurement for those readers interested in the topicReferences

In computer architecture     or IPC is one aspect of a processors performance the average number of instructions executed for each clock cycle It is the multiplicative inverse of cycles per instruction John L Hennessy David A Patterson Andrea C ArpaciDusseau Computer architecture a quantitative approach 2007  Explanation  Calculation of IPC The number of instructions per second for a processor can be derived by multiplying the instructions per cycle and the clock speed measured in cycles per second or Hertz of the processor in question The number of instructions per second is an approximate indicator of the likely performance of the processorThe number of instructions executed per clock is not a constant for a given processor it depends on how the particular software being run interacts with the processor and indeed the entire machine particularly the memory hierarchy However certain processor features tend to lead to designs that have higherthanaverage IPC values the presence of multiple arithmetic logic units an ALU is a processor subsystem that can perform elementary arithmetic and logical operations and short pipelines When comparing different instruction sets a simpler instruction set may lead to a higher IPC figure than an implementation of a more complex instruction set using the same chip technology however the more complex instruction set may be able to achieve more useful work with fewer instructions Factors governing IPC A given level of instructions per second can be achieved with a high IPC and a low clock speed like the AMD Athlon and Intel Core 2 or from a low IPC and high clock speed like the Intel Pentium 4 and to a lesser extent the AMD Bulldozer microarchitecture Both are valid processor designs and the choice between the two is often dictated by history engineering constraints or marketing pressures Computer speed The useful work that can be done with any computer depends on many factors besides the processor speed These factors include the processor architecture the internal layout of the machine the speed of the disk storage system the speed of other attached devices the efficiency of the operating system and most importantly the high level design of the application software in useFor users and purchasers of a computer system   is not a particularly useful indication of the performance of their system For an accurate measure of performance relevant to them application benchmarks are much more useful Awareness of its existence is useful in that it provides an easytograsp example of why clock speed is not the only factor relevant to computer performance See also  Cycles per instruction Megahertz myth The benchmark article provides a useful introduction to computer performance measurement for those readers interested in the topicReferences, <traceback object at 0x300e227a0>

FAIIGC LogoThe International Gliding Commission    IGC is the international governing body for the sport of gliding It is governed by meetings of delegates from national gliding associationsIt is one of several Air Sport Commissions ASC of the   FAI    FAI or World Air Sports Federation FAI is the world body for sporting aviation and the certification of world records for aeronautics and astronautics and was founded in 1905 When the IGC was founded in 1932 it was called CIVV Commission Internationale de Vol  Voile and has also been called CVSM Commission de Vol Sans Moteur It is the FAI commission responsible for the international competitions records and badges that apply to gliders and motor gliders The term sailplanes is sometimes used Hang gliders and paragliders have a separate body called the FAI CIVL Commission FAI Hang Gliding and Paragliding Commission  CIVL which stands for Commission Internationale de Vol Libre Within FAI the sport of glider aerobatics is managed by the FAI Aerobatics Commission CIVA FAI Aerobatics Commission  CIVA which stands for Commission Internationale de Voltige Arienne and also deals with poweredaircraft aerobatics  Badges In the early 1920s two flying organizations the Association of the German Model and Gliding Clubs and the Rhn Soaring Association determined that pilots would be listed as A level if they flew a glider for either 300 meters or 30 seconds and B level if they made two flights of 45 seconds in straight lines plus one of 60 seconds in an S pattern It should be remembered that these flights were made by bungee cord launches down hillsides In time a C level requiring a five minute flight was added A few years later Fritz Stamer chief flight instructor of an early gliding school designed the gull insignia which were used for these awards and later for the badges ISTUS Internationale Studienkommission fr motorlosen Flug was founded in Frankfurt on 13 June 1930 to record international gliding achievements The founding nations were Belgium France Holland Hungary Germany Italy and the USA A series of badges for gliding was devised called A B C D etc Later the D badge became known as the Silver C and more often today just the Silver Badge Earning the Silver C Badge shows that a glider pilot has achieved an altitude gain of at least 1000 m made a fivehour duration flight and has flown crosscountry for a straightline distance of at least 50 km these three attainments are usually but not invariably achieved in separate flights Specification of the badges The first recipients of the Silver C were Wolf Hirth and Robert Kronfeld on 15 February 1931In 1932 the FAI recognized gliding and formed a new section the Commission Internationale de Vol  Voile CIVV This eventually took over the role of ISTUS The FAI decided that the Silver C was sufficiently meritorious to be internationally recognised and issued the first 300 before turning the awarding over to the national societies From the beginning the lesser badges were only recorded by local gliding associations and their criteria varies although they are usually integrated into organized training programs For example in the United States a Bronze Badge is issued for demonstrated precross country flying skills beyond the C level In Britain a pilot progresses from the B to the Bronze level and then receives an additional endorsement for crosscountry training The E badge later called the Gold C and now usually just the Gold Badge was established in 1935 A pilot who has completed the Gold Badge has flown 300 km though not necessarily to a predefined goal gained 3000 m in height and has made a five hour flight only one has to be done to count for both the Silver and Gold Up to this level the badges are registered only by the national gliding associations The F Badge now the Diamond Badge started in 1949 The Diamond Badge requires three achievements flying 300 km to a predefined goal going 500 km in one flight but not necessarily to a predefined goal and gaining 5000 m in height Earning all three diamonds qualifies the pilot for the FAI registry as a Diamond Badge holder A History of American Soaring by Ralph S Barnaby Soaring Society of America 1974 The FAI also issues a diploma for a flight of 1000 km and further diplomas for increments of 250 km List of recipients of diplomas for 1000km and over Gliding recordsThe wide variety of records have been defined by the FAI Gliding Commission The classes of glider have been combined into four groups Open 15 metre World Class and Ultralight Although female pilots can claim world records in these general categories there are also additional records in these categories just for female pilots Because of the number of records the table below only

RomaninlesAlpillesFrance Arsenal Air 100  GNSS flight recordersVolkslogger flight recorderWith the advent of satellite navigation equipment at an affordable price the International Gliding Commission of FAI developed a technical specification IGC Flight Recorder Specification Edition 2 with AL1 2011531 for approved flight recorders The IGCapproved flight recorders provide precise evidence of position for competitions world records and FAI awards and other activities They replace earlier methods of observation that used photographic evidence or groundbased observers to record aircraft position The IGCapproved recorders include a pressure altitude sensor and a Global Navigation Satellite System GNSS receiver They also include data output in a standard ASCIIbased format the IGC flight data format This format is used in files with the suffix IGC that is specified in detail in Appendix A of the document Technical Specification for IGCapproved GNSS Flight Recorders It should also be mentioned that organisations outside IGC also use IGCapproved flight recorders and the IGC flight data file formatIn IGCapproved recorders GNSS and pressure altitude data is continuously recorded during flight in the form of regular fixes stored in nonvolatile memory inside the recorder Typical fix intervals set by the pilot before flight are between 5 and 15 seconds for cruising flight between turn points and between 1 and 2 seconds at or near turn points or other points of interest The pressure altitude system in an approved recorder has the same function as a barograph and must be calibrated to the ICAO ISA International Civil Aviation Organisation International Standard Atmosphere Recalibrations to check any errors from the ICAO ISA are carried out at regular intervals in the same way as an analogue barograph that uses an aneroid pressure sensor rather than an electronic pressure transducer Recorded GNSS fix data replaces the need for photography to certify the track over ground and in particular whether a particular turn points has been reached GNSS altitude data can be compared after flight with the pressure altitude data from the independent sensor in the recorder and this is a valuable check that both systems are working correctlyIn March 1995 the IGC created their GNSS FR Approval Committee IGC GFAC to test recorders for compliance with the Commissions rules the FAI Sporting Code Section 3 Gliders and Motor Gliders GFAC also issues IGCapproval documents for approved types of recorder and these documents are posted on the IGC GNSS web site For IGCapproval the recorder design includes adding a security code to the downloaded file of flight data This code and the file data itself can be checked validated at any time later using a validation program originating from the recorder manufacturer that is posted on the IGC GNSS web site for general use This validation program checks three things 1 That the file has properly originated from an approved type of recorder 2 That the recorder has not been altered from its IGCapproved state 3 That the data in the downloaded file that is being validated is identical to when it was originally downloaded form the recorder This allows the data to be used for the validation of flight performances up to and including world records There are three levels of IGCapproval and at the higher levels a publicprivate key encryption system such as RSA or equivalent is used to achieve the validation process above Recorders at the higher approval levels also have a security device such as a microswitch that operates if the recorder is opened This enables unauthorised modification to the recorder to be detected and protects the integrity of its output dataOSTIVAn associated body is

The x86 instruction set has been extended several times introducing wider registers and datatypes andor new functionality x86 integer instructions This is the full 80868088 instruction set but most if not all of these instructions are available in 32bit mode they just operate on 32bit registers eax ebx etc and values instead of their 16bit ax bx etc counterparts See also x86 assembly language for a quick tutorial for this processor family The updated instruction set is also grouped according to architecture i386 i486 i686 and more generally is referred to as x8632 and x8664 also known as AMD64

The x86 instruction set has been extended several times introducing wider registers and datatypes andor new functionality x86 integer instructions This is the full 80868088 instruction set but most if not all of these instructions are available in 32bit mode they just operate on 32bit registers eax ebx etc and values instead of their 16bit ax bx etc counterparts See also x86 assembly language for a quick tutorial for this processor family The updated instruction set is also grouped according to architecture i386 i486 i686 and more generally is referred to as x8632 and x8664 also known as AMD64

The North West Route Utilisation Strategy NWRUS is a Route Utilisation Strategy published by Network Rail in May 2007 The published NR NWRUS TravelWatch NORTHWEST press release It was the fifth RUS to be produced It was included in a map published by the Office of Rail Regulation as established in May 2007 ORR May 2007 map of RUSs It was the first of no fewer than 5 RUSs which cover specific routes in the northwest of England the others are the Lancashire  Cumbria RUS published August 2008 the Yorkshire  Humber RUS published July 2009 the Merseyside RUS published March 2009 and the West Coast Main Line RUS now scheduled for publication in summer 2011 In particular it broadly covers the Manchester journeytowork area the City lines into Liverpool Lime Street and routes from Manchester to Kirkby Southport and Blackpool corresponding to Network Rails then Route 20  North West Urban Route Plan 20 As with other RUSs the NWRUS took into account a number of responses Northern Rails response First TransPennine Express response North West Rail Users response including the Office of Rail Regulation ORR    to consultation The RUS has identified 12 generic issues and relates these to the various rail corridors in the region As has become customary with RUSs the recommendations are also nominally grouped into shortterm to end of CP4 March 2009 mediumterm CP5 2014 and some longterm thereafter solutions however the individual initiatives are not as clearly located in time as other RUSsSome issues were passed to later RUSsLancashire  Cumbria Lancashire  Cumbria RUS Merseyside Merseyside RUS Yorkshire  Humber Yorkshire  Humber RUS West Coast Main Line West Coast Main Line RUS Scoping document section 442 p6 A number of issues and provisional recommendations were viewed to be dependent on the December 2008 WCML timetable The precise effect on these possible recommendations by the implementation of that timetable is difficult to ascertainStations and their codesCentral and interchange stations in the Manchester conurbationThere are four central Manchester stations with their National Rail codes all providing various levels of interchange Manchester Piccadilly MAN Manchester Oxford Road MCO Deansgate DGT and Manchester Victoria MCV there are two Salford stations Salford Central SFD and Salford Crescent SLD both significant interchange stationsOther significant stationsCodes for some other stations in the region are as follows Liverpool Lime Street  LIV Stockport  SPT       NMN Trafford Park  TRA Hadfield  HDF Glossup  GLO Stalybridge  SYB Preston  PRE Blackburn     BPN Blackpool South  BPS Squires Gate for Blackpool airport  SQU Kirkham  Wesham  KKM    ATN    NLW Manchester Airport  MIAThe corridorsThe corridors comprise two on the periphery of central Manchester 12 spokes radiating from central Manchester and one other from Liverpool They are listed below with their general orientation and the corresponding centralinterchange stations from which they emanate where appropriate The Castlefield corridor DGTMAN This is the line from Castlefield junction west of Deansgate to Ardwick junction east of Piccadilly It is mainly twotrack except at Oxford Road station which has four through platforms and one bay Recommendations are subsumed under those for the generic issues and the Stockport corridor The Salford corridor SLDMCV This comprises two short lines with several connections to the northwest of the central Manchester area In the east they serve either Manchester Victoria station or partly via the Windsor link Ardwick junction in the west they serve either the Salford Crescent or the Chat Moss corridor Recommendations are subsumed under those for the generic issues Stockport corridor MAN This is a little east of due south of Manchester and the main route to the West Coast Main Line WCML it is also via the line through Hazel Grove the route to Buxton and via the Hope Valley line the main route to Sheffield Marple corridor MAN This is more or less southeast of Manchester and an alternative stopping route to Sheffield HadfieldGlossop corridor MAN This is more or less due east of Manchester there are no onwards services Stalybridge corridor MAN also MCV This is a little north of due east of Manchester and the main route to Leeds via Huddersfield Oldham corridor MCV This is more or less northeast of Manchester eventually connecting with the Calder Valley corridor at Rochdale Calder Valley corridor MCV This is little east of due north of Manchester it is the route to Rochdale and onwards to Hebden Bridge the main route to Halifax and Bradford Bolton corridor MAN via MCO DGT SLD MCV via SFD SLD This is more or less northwest of Manchester and the main route to Blackburn and Preston also one route to Wigan Atherton corridor MCV This is a little north of due west of Manchester and another route to Wigan Chat Moss corridor MAN via MCO MCV This is a little south of due west of Manchester and one route to Liverpool via Eccles and   CLC part of historical Cheshire Lines Committee lines corridor MAN and MCO This is a little further south of due west of Manchester and the main route to Liverpool via Warrington Northwich corridor MAN This is more or less southwest of Manchester via Sale and Altrincham Styal corridor MAN This is a little west of due south of Manchester and the route to Manchester Airport also an alternative route to the WCML via Wilmslow St Helens corridor This is a little north of due east of Liverpool and the main link with the WCML northwardsGeneric issues and sample recommendationsInadequate capacity in the peaksThere is inadequate capacity in the peaks on most corridors and this problem is likely potentially to get worse in the face of forecast increasing demand As with several other RUSs the chief solution recommended is to add cars to the trains which in many cases will require platform extensions or less commonly to provide additional services which may require other infrastructural enhancementsThe broad strategy outlined is in the short term the redistribution of the present fleet and in the medium term the provision of about 50 additional vehicles which will require extra stabling In the longer term a further approximately 50 cars may be necessary depending on whether growth is at the higher levels of expectationsLinks between the major cities in the North WestThe main link is between Liverpool and Manchester which has fewer fast services than between Manchester and Leeds though the traffic is greater Also perceived to have inadequate services are the connections from both those cities to other major urban centres eg Preston BlackburnThe RUS outlined the possibility of adding in the short term an additional fast service making 4 such trains per hour tph in each direction between Manchester and Liverpool with the proviso that all the services would need to use the same Manchester station In the medium term there are aspirations for higher linespeeds via Chat MossAlso mooted was the possibility of one extra making 2tph between Manchester and PrestonFew corridors connect through ManchesterSome services continue through Manchester and provide direct connections to significant destinations But most work into just one side of Manchester with no direct connections to another side of Manchester The largest single contribution to alleviating this problem is likely to be the relocation or redevelopment of Salford Crescent Other less substantial interventions include reinstating a bay platform at Salford Central allowing Rochdale corridor trains to continue beyond VictoriaIntegration with Metrolink requires developingIn the short term it is proposed to improve signage and passenger environment at Eccles to encourage interchange from the Chat Moss line to Metrolink in the medium term this may lead to further Chat Moss services stopping at Eccles In the long term an interchange between the CLC line and Metrolink in the Cornbrook or Pomona area may be developed partly dependent on the results at EcclesLinks to the regions airport are insufficientThe area has three airports Manchester Liverpool John Lennon and Blackpool There is a perception that rail links need to be improved A third platform at MIA was planned which would ease the problem of reactionary delays on relevant services Improved interchange at Salford Crescent would improve accessibility to MIA tofrom a number of locations No recommendations with respect to the other two airports other than better regional links generally were acceptedFreight traffic and growth is constrained by existing capacitycapabilityThe Freight RUS identified the Castlefield route as a capacity pinch point The NWRUS identified a number of possible interventions some of which would have impacts on other issuesAccess to Trafford Park container terminal is constrained and may be alleviated by lengthening trains in the short term and infrastructure enhancements in the medium termSimplification of handling of stone trains from Peak Forest including remodelling at Buxton is desirable and clearing of the route through New Mills Guide Bridge Stockport or Victoria to RA10 capability by prioritising renewal of structures 2007 to 2014 was recommended this would improve overall performance on the routePlatforms at Salford Crescent and Manchester Piccadilly are congested at timesSalford Crescent comprises a simple island platform but has in practice become a major actual and potential interchange point as well a significant destination in its own right It is highly desirable that the station be developed to handle the present and desired traffic the currentlyfavoured option is to move the station northwards to a more spacious location as minimal alterations to the layout would be required if so the enhanced facilities would include 4 through platforms and two bay platformsLack of facilities including parking at some stationsGuide Bridge and   are to be developed as parkandride locationsA significant number of stations see very light trafficNo fewer than 44 stations have below 50 regular passengers However none is scheduled for immediate closure because of the cost and involvement of doing so But increased traffic on other stations on these routes and other factors may make this unavoidable In that case the full process for the closing of stations will have to be gone throughReactionary delays tending to perpetuate lowering performanceThis is particularly the case on the Castlefield corridor however the RUS states mainly that the effect of various interventions could not be assessed until the December 2008 WCML timetables were knownA lot of rolling stock fits the current use poorlyThis issue

Commonwealth of Australia Some other countries have analogous police forces such as the provincial police in some Canadian provinces Particularly in the United States the primary goals of most state police agencies are the safety of motorists on interstate highways and the enforcement of traffic laws on those interstate highwaysAustraliaEach state of Australia has its own state police force Municipalities do not have police forces and it is left to the state forces to police the geographic areas within their respective states Australia does have a national police force the Australian Federal Police whose role is to enforce the laws of the Commonwealth both criminal law and civil law as well as to protect the interests of the Commonwealth both domestically and internationally The

der Insel Minsener Oog Landesbetrieb Landesvermessung und Geobasisinformation Niedersachsen DGM5 Verfgbarkeit LandkreisStadt Friesland As at 23 October 2009 It has been artificially enlarged through the construction of groynesLocationThe island is located just two kilometres southeast of the island of Wangerooge from which it is separated by the creek of Blaue Balje and four miles north of the mainland The nearest towns on the mainland are Minsen and Schillig The islands landowner is the   Water and Shipping Authority     or WSA Name The name of the isle comes from the village of Minsen which lies opposite it on the mainland There is a legend that Minsen was originally established on the island of Minsener Oog The fishermen of the village caught a mermaid with the lower body of a fish which then had the village drowned by a flood in revenge Although this tradition is historically extremely doubtful there is in Minsen a bronze sculpture of the Minsen Seewiefken which is also the emblem on the coat of arms for the parish of Wangerland History On a 1906 map only the Minsener Sand lighthouse is shown Minsener Oog was formed from the Minsener Oog sandbanks and the Olde Oog or Steen Plate sandbank 200 to 300 metres to the south In 1906 the   Marine Construction Authority erected groynes and embankments on the Olde Oog and dams to prevent the channel of the River Jade from silting up This was intended to keep the channel to   clear of sand drifting from east to west especially for the fleet of the German Imperial Navy On the original 7 km sand bank of Olde Oog there was a small area of dunes as on Minsener Oog By building long connecting groynes the sand was held back and formed a foredune which quickly established itself as a breeding ground for seabirdsOriginally it was planned to connect Wangerooge with Minsener OldeOog to prevent the erosion of Wangerooge In the 1930s this project was temporarily reinstated but the events of war prevented further work in this direction After the Second World War the British occupation forces tried to render   unusable as a naval base by letting the Jade estuary silt up completely A major embankment on Minsener Oog was blown up but no further action was taken Present state Radar Tower narrowgauge railway on Groyne C and WSA building yardTo keep the Jade channel clear a new largescale dune island was formed in the 1970s Between 1975 and 1978 about 10 million m of dredged material was dumped from the Jade channel thus increasingly enlarging the southern part of the island This now has sand dunes up to 12 m high and is covers an area of about 370 hectares Through the planting of beachgrass erosion could be largely contained The island is 45 km long from northsouth and up to 15 km wideAfter the Second World War the   Water and Shipping Authority WSA was particularly active on the Minsener Oog Two groyne wardens did shift work looking after the various maintenance tasks on the island In addition to the radar tower built in 1976 a larger accommodation facility was erected in the form of pile dwellings for the WSAs staffAt the end of the groyne A in the north there is still a small flak tower made of concrete which was built during the Second World War and served as a lighthouse until 1998  In 1998 the   Water and Shipping Authority WSA gave up its permanent presence on the island for reasons of cost and only deploys staff as neededSince the automation of the beacon however only a bird warden from the Mellumrat resides on Minsener Oog during the summer breeding season who shares the living quarters of the water and shipping authority The island is considered one of the most important research areas for the Institute of Avian Research Institut fr VogelforschungFile20120513

1959Breeding birds in 2004 were the Herring Gull Lesser Blackbacked Gull Common Gull Common Tern Arctic tern Sandwich Tern and Little Tern as well as the Magpie Carrion Crow and Swallow While the numbers of terns amount to more than 2000 pairs only a few pairs of the Little Tern were noted Shelduck and Stock Dove have bred in the rabbit holes Tourism In the summer months mudflat hikes are conducted from Schillig on the mainland to the island But for conservation reasons only a small part of the island may be entered The whole island is a nature reserve and belongs to the quiet zone of

der Insel Minsener Oog Landesbetrieb Landesvermessung und Geobasisinformation Niedersachsen DGM5 Verfgbarkeit LandkreisStadt Friesland As at 23 October 2009 It has been artificially enlarged through the construction of groynesLocationThe island is located just two kilometres southeast of the island of Wangerooge from which it is separated by the creek of Blaue Balje and four miles north of the mainland The nearest towns on the mainland are Minsen and Schillig The islands landowner is the   Water and Shipping Authority     or WSA Name The name of the isle comes from the village of Minsen which lies opposite it on the mainland There is a legend that Minsen was originally established on the island of Minsener Oog The fishermen of the village caught a mermaid with the lower body of a fish which then had the village drowned by a flood in revenge Although this tradition is historically extremely doubtful there is in Minsen a bronze sculpture of the Minsen Seewiefken which is also the emblem on the coat of arms for the parish of Wangerland History On a 1906 map only the Minsener Sand lighthouse is shown Minsener Oog was formed from the Minsener Oog sandbanks and the Olde Oog or Steen Plate sandbank 200 to 300 metres to the south In 1906 the   Marine Construction Authority erected groynes and embankments on the Olde Oog and dams to prevent the channel of the River Jade from silting up This was intended to keep the channel to   clear of sand drifting from east to west especially for the fleet of the German Imperial Navy On the original 7 km sand bank of Olde Oog there was a small area of dunes as on Minsener Oog By building long connecting groynes the sand was held back and formed a foredune which quickly established itself as a breeding ground for seabirdsOriginally it was planned to connect Wangerooge with Minsener OldeOog to prevent the erosion of Wangerooge In the 1930s this project was temporarily reinstated but the events of war prevented further work in this direction After the Second World War the British occupation forces tried to render   unusable as a naval base by letting the Jade estuary silt up completely A major embankment on Minsener Oog was blown up but no further action was taken Present state Radar Tower narrowgauge railway on Groyne C and WSA building yardTo keep the Jade channel clear a new largescale dune island was formed in the 1970s Between 1975 and 1978 about 10 million m of dredged material was dumped from the Jade channel thus increasingly enlarging the southern part of the island This now has sand dunes up to 12 m high and is covers an area of about 370 hectares Through the planting of beachgrass erosion could be largely contained The island is 45 km long from northsouth and up to 15 km wideAfter the Second World War the   Water and Shipping Authority WSA was particularly active on the Minsener Oog Two groyne wardens did shift work looking after the various maintenance tasks on the island In addition to the radar tower built in 1976 a larger accommodation facility was erected in the form of pile dwellings for the WSAs staffAt the end of the groyne A in the north there is still a small flak tower made of concrete which was built during the Second World War and served as a lighthouse until 1998  In 1998 the   Water and Shipping Authority WSA gave up its permanent presence on the island for reasons of cost and only deploys staff as neededSince the automation of the beacon however only a bird warden from the Mellumrat resides on Minsener Oog during the summer breeding season who shares the living quarters of the water and shipping authority The island is considered one of the most important research areas for the Institute of Avian Research Institut fr VogelforschungFile20120513

1959Breeding birds in 2004 were the Herring Gull Lesser Blackbacked Gull Common Gull Common Tern Arctic tern Sandwich Tern and Little Tern as well as the Magpie Carrion Crow and Swallow While the numbers of terns amount to more than 2000 pairs only a few pairs of the Little Tern were noted Shelduck and Stock Dove have bred in the rabbit holes Tourism In the summer months mudflat hikes are conducted from Schillig on the mainland to the island But for conservation reasons only a small part of the island may be entered The whole island is a nature reserve and belongs to the quiet zone of

Poetry has been featured extensively in Thai literature and constituted the nearexclusive majority of literary works up to the early Rattanakosin period early 19th century It consists of five main forms known as khlong chan kap klon and rai some of these developed indigenously while others were borrowed from other languages Thai poetry dates to the Sukhothai period 13th14th centuries and flourished under Ayutthaya 14th18th centuries during which it developed into its current forms Though many works were lost to the Burmese conquest of Ayutthaya in 1767 sponsorship by subsequent kings helped revive the art with new works created by many great poets including Sunthorn Phu 17861855 Prose writing as a literary form was introduced as a Western import during the reign of King Mongkut 185168 and gradually gained popularity though poetry saw a revival during the reign of King Vajiravudh 191025 who authored and sponsored both traditional poetry and the newer literary forms Poetrys popularity as a mainstream form of literature gradually declined afterwards although it is still written and read and is regularly employed ceremoniallyFormsThai poetic works follow established forms known as chanthalak   Almost all have rules governing the exact metre and rhyme structure ie the number of syllables in each line and which syllable rhymes with which Certain forms also specify the tone or tone marks of syllables others have requirements of syllable heaviness Alliteration and withinline rhyming are also often employed but are not required by the rulesKhlongThe khlong   is the among oldest Thai poetic forms This is reflected in its requirements on the tone markings of certain syllables which must be marked with mai ek    or mai tho    This was likely derived from when the Thai language had three tones as opposed to todays five a split which occurred during the Ayutthaya period two of which corresponded directly to the aforementioned marks It is usually regarded as an advanced and sophisticated poetic form Reproduced form In khlong a stanza bot   has a number of lines bat   from Pali and Sanskrit pda depending on the type The bat are subdivided into two wak   from Sanskrit varga In literary studies line in western poetry is translated as bat However in some forms the unit is more equivalent to wak To avoid confusion this article will refer to wak and bat instead of line which may refer to either The first wak has five syllables the second has a variable number also depending on the type and may be optional The type of khlong is named by the number of

Khlong si suphapThe khlong si suphap   is the most common form still currently employed It has four bat per stanza si translates as four The first wak of each bat has five syllables The second wak has

In coin collecting coin grading is the process of determining the grade or condition of a coin one of the key factors in determining its value as a collectors itemThe grading of a coin includes the analysis of several criteria the most important being the quality the rarity the interest factor and the liquidity factorOverviewCoin grading has evolved over the years to a system of finer and finer grade distinctions Originally there were only two grades new and usedThis evolved for a time to the letter grading system beginning with the lowest grade  Basal State also Poor PO then continuing Fair Fr About or Almost Good AG Good G Very Good VG Fine F Very Fine VF Extra Fine EF or XF Almost or About Uncirculated AU Uncirculated Unc and up to Brilliant Uncirculated BU Gem Uncirculated was roughly equivalent in usage to BU at that timeThe British grading system is similar except that Good and Very Good are Poor and Fair respectively The word Good used to describe a coin under the British grading system is usually an indication that it is at the higher end of its grading classification eg a Good Fine coin will be in a better condition than a coin that is merely FineWilliam H Sheldon in his book Penny Whimsy is credited with coming up with the Sheldon Scale in the 1950s a numeric system going from 170 It was intended to be a reflection of the relative value of a 1794 Large Cent which

often has its own ideas about quality and grading compared to the rest of the coin collecting community until the mid 1980sNow it is widely known that the numbers are a scale 70 being a perfect coin

generally five main components which determine a coins grade strike surface preservation luster coloration and eye appeal  Quality grading  Early grading systems The quality of all coins is not equal and collectors felt the necessity of defining the quality of the coins in order to assess their value Rims nicks polishing scratches and other forms of wear are considered factors in grading a coin Also if coins have been in some form of jewelry also affects the gradingIn the early years of coin collecting three general terms were used to grade coins good  when circulation had worn the surface of the coin but details were still visible fine  when features were less worn and a bit of mint luster showed on the surface uncirculated  when the features of the coin were sharp and the luster approaching the state of the coin at the mint  The Sheldon grading system As the collector market for coins grew rapidly in the late 19th century and early 20th century it became apparent that a more precise grading standard was needed Some coins were simply more fine than others and some uncirculated coins showed more luster and far fewer marks than others Terms like gem uncirculated and very fine began to see use as more precise grading descriptions allowed for more precise pricing for the booming collector market In 1948 a wellknown numismatist by the name of Dr William Herbert Sheldon attempted to standardize coin grading by proposing what is now known as the Sheldon ScaleSheldons scale included in his famous work Penny Whimsy was originally devised specifically for United States large cents but it is now applied to all series The scale runs from 0 to 70 where 0 means that you can pretty much tell that it was once a coin while 70 means that it is perfect  European grading

inferior counterfeit coins Unfortunately some better counterfeits have since come into being further justifying the need for professional authentication in a counterfeitauthentication arms raceRarity factorThe value of coins depends on their rarity There are several scales which have been developed for the definition of the rarity of a particular coin The most common are the Sheldon rarity scale and the Universal rarity scale  The Sheldon rarity scale The Sheldon scale has been developed by William Herbert Sheldon in 1958 and consists of a progression of eight levels in which the population of all coin varieties are to fall Each level is prefaced with the letter R indicating rarity While being developed for the one cent coins which he studied the scale has been used for defining the rarity of all coins Sheldon Rarity Scale Rarity Description  R1 Common readily available  R2 Less common  Available at most shows but in limited quantity  R3 Scarce  somewhat difficult to find only a few likely at larger shows  R4 Very scarce  may or may not find at larger showsauctions  R5 Rare  unlikely more than 5 at shows or auctions each year  R6 Very rare  Almost never seen only one may be offered for sale in a years time  R7 Prohibitively rare  one may be offered for sale once every few years  R8 Unique or nearly so   The Universal rarity scale The Universal rarity scale URS was

factor would be in high demand with several thousands of collectors desiring the variety A medium interest factor may indicate that the variety is desired by hundreds or a few thousand people and a low interest factor might indicate that the coin is sought by just a handful of collectors As a variety receives more publicity within the numismatic press the interest factor may rise as demand increases This may cause the price or value of certain varieties to increase without any change in the estimated quantity available On the other hand if a large quantity of a variety surfaces the value of that variety may decrease as the supply outstrips the demand As in other segments of the hobby a combination of supply and demand almost always dictates the price or value of a particular varietyLiquidity factorThe Liquidity factor is a measurement developed by J T Stanton president of PCI Grading Company to indicate how quickly or how easily a coin or variety should sell at auction given normal market conditions Using a scale of 1 to 5 a Liquidity factor of 1 would indicate that the coin would not normally sell very easily or fast and usually at a discount from suggested values A Liquidity factor of 5 would be expected to sell right away and generally command full or inflated suggested values Hot or highly active market conditions would usually inflate the Liquidity of any coin with a cold market causing the oppositeGrading servicesAs of 2010 there are two prevalent coin grading services PCGS and NGC ANACS is considered the third leading service and is also quite credible but does not carry the market acceptance or liquidity of the other two ICG is the fourth largest There are subtle variations in the grades assigned by each of these major services and prospective buyers are encouraged to seek professional or expert advice before making any important rare coin purchasesAn interesting contender among previous grading services was Compugrade In 1990

board of directors caused Henry Merton to telephone the Editor of Coin World to ask her to publish the letter that he had filed with her That letter acknowledged assistance from numismatists who had not signed release forms for their contribution of information to the writing of the patent That letter to the editor wiped out Compugrades exclusivity by placing the patent in the public domain which was Mertons intentIn the May 26 2003 edition of Coin World the hobby newspaper had announced they had contracted investigators to conduct a yearlong comparative study of PCGS ANACS NGC and ICG along

coin being graded by all Third Party Graders sent to The findings were In no case did the grading services agree on the grade of any given coin and in some cases the difference in grading was as much as seven points off By way of example a finding published by Coin World involved one case where ACCGS had graded a coin as cleaned which lowers the coin value Additionally the coin had been graded several grades lower than PCGS while PCGS had not noted the same coin was in fact cleaned It is standard in US numismatics to grade coins on a pointscale from 1 poor to 70 perfect and to note if a coin has been cleaned or poorly mishandled or in some cases to reject it for encapsulationOn January 5 2007 the Professional Numismatists Guild PNG published a more recent report about grading

In coin collecting coin grading is the process of determining the grade or condition of a coin one of the key factors in determining its value as a collectors itemThe grading of a coin includes the analysis of several criteria the most important being the quality the rarity the interest factor and the liquidity factorOverviewCoin grading has evolved over the years to a system of finer and finer grade distinctions Originally there were only two grades new and usedThis evolved for a time to the letter grading system beginning with the lowest grade  Basal State also Poor PO then continuing Fair Fr About or Almost Good AG Good G Very Good VG Fine F Very Fine VF Extra Fine EF or XF Almost or About Uncirculated AU Uncirculated Unc and up to Brilliant Uncirculated BU Gem Uncirculated was roughly equivalent in usage to BU at that timeThe British grading system is similar except that Good and Very Good are Poor and Fair respectively The word Good used to describe a coin under the British grading system is usually an indication that it is at the higher end of its grading classification eg a Good Fine coin will be in a better condition than a coin that is merely FineWilliam H Sheldon in his book Penny Whimsy is credited with coming up with the Sheldon Scale in the 1950s a numeric system going from 170 It was intended to be a reflection of the relative value of a 1794 Large Cent which was then worth 1 in Basal State and 70 in Uncirculated MS70This numerical system was used primarily within the community of large copper coin collectors a very specialized part of numismatics that often has its own ideas about quality and grading compared to the rest of the coin collecting community until the mid 1980sNow it is widely known that the numbers are a scale 70 being a perfect coin

Boxers with natural and cropped ears and docked tailsDocking is the removal of portions of an animals tail While docking and bobbing are more commonly used to refer to removal of the tail the term cropping Ear Cropping is used in reference to the ears Tail docking occurs in one of two ways The first involves constricting the blood supply to the tail with a rubber ligature for a few days until the tail falls off The second involves the severance of the tail with surgical scissors or a scalpel The tail is amputated at the dockAt least 17 dog breeds including the Corgi have naturally occurring bob tail lines These appear similar to docked dogs but are a distinct naturally occurring genotypeHistoryHistorically tail docking was thought to prevent rabies strengthen the back increase the animals speed and prevent injuries when ratting fighting and baiting A review of the scientific aspects and veterinary opinions relating to tail docking in dogs In early Georgian times in the United Kingdom a tax was levied upon working dogs with tails and so many types of dogs were docked to avoid this tax The tax was repealed in 1796 but that did not stop the practice from persistingTail docking is done in modern times either for prophylactic therapeutic or cosmetic purposes For dogs that worked in the field such as some hunting dogs and herding dogs tails could collect burrs and foxtails causing pain and infection and due to the tails wagging may be subject to abrasion or other injury while moving through dense brush or thicketsDocking to puppies fewer than 10 to 14 days old is routinely carried out by both breeders and veterinarians without anesthesia DEFRA  CDB Submission Opponents of these procedures state that most tail dockings are done for aesthetic reasons rather than health concerns and are unnecessarily painful for the dog They point out that even nonworking show or pet dogs are routinely docked As a result tail defects that docking proponents claim makes docking necessary in the first place are perpetuated in the breeds They point to the many breeds of working dogs with long tails that are not traditionally docked including English Pointers Setters Herding dogs and FoxhoundsRobert Wansborough argued in a 1996 paper that docking tails puts dogs at a disadvantage in several ways First dogs use their tails to communicate with other dogs and with people a dog without a tail might be significantly handicapped in conveying fear caution aggression playfulness and so on Certain breeds use their tails as rudders when swimming and possibly for balance when running so active dogs with docked tails might be at a disadvantage compared to their tailed peers In 2007 Stephen Leaver a graduate student at the University of Victoria published a paper on tail docking which found that tail length was important in the transmission of social cues The study found that dogs with shorter tails docked tails would be approached with caution as if the approaching dog was unsure of the emotional state of the docked dog The study goes on to suggest that dogs with docked tails may grow up to be more aggressive The reasoning postulated by Tom Reimchen UVic Biologist and supervisor of the study was that dogs who grew up without being able to efficiently transmit social cues would grow up to be more antisocial and thus more aggressive httpwwwcanadacomvancouversunnewsstoryhtmlidc42371b78b744e758d85e19bbf161361k67117 Wansborough also investigates seven years of records from an urban veterinary practice to demonstrate that undocked tails result in less harm than docked tailsCritics point out that kennel clubs with breed standards that do not make allowance for uncropped or undocked dogs put pressure on owners and breeders to continue the practice Although the American Kennel Club AKC says that it has no rules that require docking or that make undocked animals ineligible for the show ring faq American Kennel Club standards for many breeds put undocked animals at a disadvantage for the conformation show ring The American breed standard for boxers for example recommends that an undocked tail be severely penalized Boxer Breed Standard American Kennel Club The AKC position is that ear cropping and tail docking are acceptable practices integral to defining and preserving breed character andor enhancing good health Ear Cropping Tail Docking and Dewclaw Removal American Kennel Club Canine Legislation Position Statements even though the practice is currently opposed by the American Veterinary Medical Association AVMAorg Legal statusA Doberman Pinscher puppy with its ears taped to train them into the desired shape and carriage after croppingToday many countries ban cropping and docking because they consider the practices unnecessary painful cruel or mutilation In Europe the cropping of ears is prohibited in all countries that have ratified the European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals Some countries that ratified the convention made exceptions for tail dockingUnited KingdomShow dogs are no longer docked in the United Kingdom A dog docked before 28 March 2007 in Wales and 6 April 2007 in England may continue to be shown at all shows in England Wales Scotland and Northern Ireland throughout its life A dog docked on or after the above dates regardless of where it was docked may not be shown at shows in England and Wales where the public is charged a fee for admission Where a working dog has been docked in England and Wales under the respective regulations however it may be shown where the public is charged a fee so long as it is shown only to demonstrate its working ability It will thus be necessary to show working dogs in such a way as only to demonstrate their working ability and not conformity to a standard A dog legally docked in England Wales Northern Ireland or abroad may be shown at any show in Scotland or Northern IrelandIn England and Wales ear cropping is illegal and no dog with cropped ears can take part in any Kennel Club event including agility and other nonconformation events Tail docking is also illegal except for a few working breeds this exemption applies only when carried out by a registered veterinary surgeonThe Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons RCVS the regulatory body for veterinary surgeons in the United Kingdom has said that they consider tail docking to be an unjustified mutilation and unethical unless done for therapeutic or acceptable prophylactic reasons In 1995 a veterinary surgeon was brought before the RCVS disciplinary council for disgraceful professional conduct for carrying out cosmetic docking The surgeon claimed that the docking was performed to prevent future injuries and the case was dismissed for lack of evidence otherwise Although cosmetic docking is still considered unacceptable by the RCVS no further disciplinary action has been taken against vets performing dockingThe Animal Welfare Act 2006 makes the docking of dogs tails a criminal offence except for working dogs such as those used by the police force the military rescue services pest control and those used in connection with lawful animal shooting Three options were presented to Parliament in March 2006 with Parliament opting for the second An outright ban on docking dogs tails opposed by a majority of 278 to 267 A ban on docking dogs tails with an exception for working dogs supported by a majority of 476 to 63 Retention of the status quoThose convicted of unlawful docking are liable to a fine of up to 20000 up to 51

obsolete it was widely used during much of the twentieth century for teleprinter communication for input to computers of the 1950s and 1960s and later as a storage medium for minicomputers and CNC machine toolsOriginA Monotype keyboard part of the Monotype System was used for punching a paper tape reel visible at top which was then fed into a machine for mechanical typesettingPaper tape reader

Programming Manual The earliest forms of punched tape come from weaving looms and embroidery where cards with simple instructions about a machines intended movements were first fed individually as instructions then controlled by instruction cards and later were fed as a string of connected cards See Jacquard loomThis led to the concept of communicating data not as a stream of individual cards but one continuous card or a tape Many professional embroidery operations still refer to those individuals who create the designs and machine patterns as punchers even though punched cards and paper tape were eventually phased out after many years of use in the 1990sIn 1846 Alexander Bain used punched tape to send telegramsIn the 1880s and 90s the Monotype System of mechanical typesetting was developed In it a keyboard was used for punching a paper tape so as to indicate the letters desired for printing this was then fed into a separate machine which casted the desired metal type for use in a printing pressTape formatsData was represented by the presence or absence of a hole at a particular location Tapes originally had five rows of holes for data Later tapes had six seven and eight rows An early electromechanical calculating machine the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator or Harvard Mark I used paper tape with 24 rows A row of narrower holes that were always punched served to feed the tape originally using a wheel with radial teeth called a sprocket wheel Later optical readers used the sprocket holes to generate timing pulsesText was encoded in several ways The earliest standard character encoding was Baudot which dates back to the nineteenth century and had five holes Later standards such as Teletypesetter TTS Fieldata and Friden Flexowriter had six holes In the

pieces had a tendency to escape and interfere with the other electromechanical parts of the teleprinter equipmentChadless 5level Baudot paper tape circa 19751980 punched at Teletype CorpOne variation on the tape punch was a device called a Chadless Printing Reperforator This machine would punch a received teleprinter signal into tape and print the message on it at the same time using a printing mechanism similar to that of an ordinary page printer The tape punch rather than punching out the usual round holes would instead punch little Ushaped cuts in the paper so that no chad would be produced the hole was still filled with a little paper trapdoor By not fully punching out the hole the printing on the paper remained intact and legible This enabled operators to read the tape without having to decipher the holes which would facilitate relaying the message on to another station in the network Also there was no chad box to empty from time to time A disadvantage to this mechanism was that chadless tape once punched did not roll up well because the protruding flaps of paper would catch on the next layer of tape so it could not be rolled up tightly Another disadvantage as seen over time was that there was no reliable way to read chadless tape by optical means employed by later highspeed readers However the mechanical tape readers used in most standardspeed equipment had no

operated continuously By preparing the tape offline and then sending the message with a tape reader the line could operate continuously rather than depending on continuous online typing by a single

This is a list of file formats organized by type as can be found on computers Filename extensions are usually noted in parentheses if they differ from the format name or abbreviation In theory using the basic Latin alphabet AZ and an extension of up to three singlecased letters 18279 combinations can be made 263262261260 When other acceptable characters are accepted the maximum number is increased very possibly to a number consisting of at least six digits Many operating systems do not limit filenames to a single extension shorter than 4 characters like what was common with some operating systems that supported the FAT file system Examples of operating systems that dont have such a small limit includeUnixlike systems Also Microsoft Windows NT 95 98 and Me dont have a three character limit on extensions for 32bit or 64bit applications on file systems other than preWindows 95Windows NT 35 versions of the FAT file system Some filenames are given extensions longer than three characters Archive and compressed  Q  files compressed by the SQ program 7z  7Zip compressed file AAC    ace  ACE compressed file ALZ  ALZip compressed file APK  Applications installable on

California standards include Arizona 2012 model year Connecticut Maine Maryland Massachusetts New Jersey New Mexico 2011 model year New York Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island Vermont and Washington as well as the District of Columbia Such states are frequently referred to as CARB states in automotive discussions because the regulations are defined by the California Air Resources BoardThe EPA has adopted the California emissions standards as a national standard by the 2016 model year and is collaborating with California regulators on stricter national emissions standards for model years 20172025  Lightduty vehicles Two sets or tiers of emission standards for lightduty vehicles in the United States were defined as a result of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 The Tier I standard was adopted in 1991 and was phased in from 1994 to 1997 Tier II standards are being phased in from 2004 to 2009Within the Tier II ranking there is a subranking ranging from BIN 110 with 1 being the cleanest Zero Emission vehicle and 10 being the dirtiest The former Tier 1 standards that were effective from 1994 until 2003 were different between automobiles and light trucks SUVs pickup trucks and minivans but Tier II standards are the same for both typesThese standards specifically restrict emissions of carbon monoxide CO oxides of nitrogen NOx particulate matter PM formaldehyde HCHO and nonmethane organic gases NMOG or nonmethane hydrocarbons NMHC The limits are defined in grams per mile gmi Phase 1 199499 Were phased in from 1994 to 1997 and are being phased out in favor of the national Tier 2 standard from 2004 to 2009Tier I standards cover vehicles with a gross vehicular weight rating GVWR below 8500 pounds 3856 kg and are divided into five categories one for passenger cars and four for lightduty trucks which include SUVs and minivans divided up based on the vehicle weight and cargo capacityCalifornias Lowemission vehicle LEV program defines automotive emission standards which are stricter than the United States national Tier regulations It contains various emissions levels one of which is confusingly named Lowemission vehicle LEV In increasing stringency these areThe LEV standard created six major emission categories each with several targets available depending on vehicle weight and cargo capacity Vehicles with a test weight up to 14000 pounds 6350 kg were covered by the regulations The major emission categories wereTLEV    LEV  Lowemission vehicleULEV        Zeroemission vehicleThe last category is largely restricted to electric vehicles and hydrogen cars although such vehicles are usually not entirely nonpolluting In those cases the other emissions are transferred to another site such as a power plant or hydrogen reforming center unless such sites run on renewable energy However a batterypowered electric vehicle charged from the California power grid will still be up to ten times cleaner than even the cleanest gasoline vehicles over their respective lifetime due to Californias clean renewable energy infrastructureTransitional NLEV 19992003 A set of transitional and initially voluntary national low emission vehicle NLEV standards were in effect starting in 1999 for northeastern states and 2001 in the rest of the country until Tier II adopted in 1999 began to be phased in from 2004 onwards The National Low Emission Vehicle program covered vehicles below 6000 pounds GVWR and adapted the national standards to accommodate Californias stricter regulations Phase 2 200409 Instead of basing emissions on vehicle weight Tier II standards are divided into several numbered bins Eleven bins were initially defined with bin 1 being the cleanest zeroemission vehicle and 11 the dirtiest However bins 9 10 and 11 are temporary Only the first ten bins were used for lightduty vehicles below 8500 pounds GVWR but mediumduty passenger vehicles up to 10000 pounds 4536 kg GVWR and to all 11 bins Manufacturers can make vehicles which fit into any of the available bins but still must meet average targets for their entire fleetsThe two leastrestrictive bins for passenger cars 9 and 10 were phased out at the end of 2006 However bins 9 and 10 were available for classifying a restricted number of lightduty trucks until the end of 2008 when they were removed along with bin 11 for mediumduty vehicles As of 2009 lightduty trucks must meet the same emissions standards as passenger carsTier II regulations also defined restrictions for the amount of sulfur allowed in gasoline and diesel fuel since sulfur can interfere with the operation of advanced exhaust treatment systems such as selective catalytic converters and particulate filters Sulfur content in gasoline was limited to an average of 120 partspermillion maximum 300 ppm in 2004 and this was reduced to an average 30 ppm maximum 80 ppm for 2006 Ultralow sulfur diesel began to be restricted to a maximum 15 ppm in 2006 and refiners are to be 100 compliant with that level by 2010 Phase 3A 201016 In 2009 President Barack Obama announced a new national fuel economy and emissions policy that incorporated Californias contested plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions on its own apart from federal government regulationsThe combined fleet fuel economy for an auto manufacturer of cars and trucks with a GVWR of 10000 lbs or less will have to average 355mpg The average for its cars will have to be 42 mpg and for its trucks will be 26 mpg by 2016 all based upon CAFE Standards If the manufacturers do not meet these standards they will be assessed a 5 fee per vehicle made for every 1mpg that theyre under the standard for Corporate Average Fuel Economy A second round of California standards known as Low Emission Vehicle II is timed to coordinate with the Tier 2 rolloutUnder LEV II regulations the Tier I and TLEV classifications were removed for 2004 and the remaining LEV ULEV and SULEV categories were made more stringent These stricter versions are therefore known as LEV II ULEV II and SULEV II Tier IIs bin 5 roughly defines what fleet averages should be and is equivalent to Californias LEV II classificationThe following new categories were also createdILEV  Inherently lowemission vehiclePZEV     Advanced technology partial zero emission vehicleNLEV    PZEV and ATPZEV ratings are for vehicles which achieve a SULEV II rating and also have systems to eliminate evaporative emissions from the fuel system and which have 150000mile15year warranties on emissioncontrol components Several ordinary gasoline vehicles from the 2001 and later model years qualify as PZEVsIf a PZEV has technology that can also be used in ZEVs like an electric motor or highpressure gaseous fuel tanks for compressed natural gas CNG or liquified petroleum gas LPG it qualifies as an ATPZEV Hybrid electric vehicles like the Toyota Prius can qualify as can internal combustion engine vehicles that run on natural gas like the Honda Civic GX These vehicles are called partial ZEVs because they receive partial credit in place of ZEVs that automakers would otherwise be required to sell in California Heavyduty vehicles Heavyduty vehicles must comply with more stringent exhaust emission standards and requires ultralow sulfur diesel ULSD fuel 15 ppm maximum beginning in 2007 Greenhouse gasesFederal emissions regulations do not cover the primary component of vehicle exhaust carbon dioxide CO2 Since CO2 emissions are proportional tothe amount of fuel used the national Corporate Average Fuel Economy regulations are the primary way in which automotive CO2 emissions are regulated in the US However the EPA is facing a lawsuit seeking to compel it to regulate greenhouse gases as a pollutantAs of 2007 the California Air Resources Board passed strict greenhouse gas emission standards See California Air Resources Board for more information and references which are being challenged in the courts On September 12 2007 a judge in Vermont ruled in favor of allowing states to conditionally regulate greenhouse gas GHG emissions from new cars and trucks defeating an attempt by automakers to block state emissions standards A group of automakers including General Motors DaimlerChrysler and the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers had sued the state of Vermont in order to block rules calling for a 30 percent reduction in GHG emissions by 2016 Members of the auto industry argued that complying with these regulations would require major technological advances and raise the prices of vehicles as much as 6000 per automobile US District Judge William K Sessions III dismissed these claims in his ruling The court remains unconvinced automakers cannot meet the challenge of Vermont and Californias greenhouse gas regulations he wroteMeanwhile environmentalists continue to press the Bush Administration to grant California a waiver from the EPA in order for its emissions standards to take effect Doing so would allow Vermont and other states to adopt these same standards under the Clean Air Act Without such a waiver Judge Sessions wrote the Vermont rules will be invalidrefhttpwwwdetnewscomappspbcsdllarticleAID20070912UPDATE7091204561148AUTO01 httpwwwvtduscourtsgovCases05cv302html  Consumer ratings Air pollution score EPAs air pollution score represents the

consumer usage The scoring is from 0 to 10 where 10 represents the lowest amount of greenhouse gasesThe Greenhouse gas score is determined from the vehicles estimated fuel economy and its fuel type The lower the fuel economy the more greenhouse gas is emitted as a byproduct of combustion The amount of carbon dioxide emitted per liter or gallon burned varies by fuel type since each type of fuel contains a different amount of carbon per gallon or literThe ratings reflect carbon dioxide CO2 nitrous oxide N20 and methane CH4 emissions weighted to reflect each gas relative contribution to the

The Red Bull XAlps is one of the worlds toughest adventure races Athletes must either hike or fly almost 900 km across the Alps from Salzburg to Monaco in the fastest time possible Every kilometer must be covered either on foot or flown in a paraglider Its a formidable undertaking and takes place in one of the most breathtaking and unforgiving environments Each team consists of one athlete and up to two supporters No technical or outside assistance is allowed It requires expert paragliding experience and a very high level of endurance fitness  its not uncommon for athletes to hike up to 100 km in a day The 2013 race will be the sixth edition of the Red Bull XAlps and comes on the tenyear anniversary of the first raceThe RaceThe race starts in Salzburg and finishes in Monaco a distance of almost 900 km as the crow flies The route passes various predefinied turnpoints that change each edition Previous turnpoints have included the Dachstein mountain in Austria and the Matterhorn in

good athletes use paragliders to fly and when they are not they must run or hike carrying their paraglider and other mandatory equipment No other form of transport is permitted The winner is the first

may be able to hike to a key point where they can extend their lead or pass teams in front But the price is a missed night of recovery And they can only do this once says Red Bull XAlps race director Christoph WeberAthletes cannot pull the Night Pass spontaneously but will need to announce their intention in advance to the race committee Furthermore they will not know who else is using the card

chance to break the mandatory rest stop on just one occasion and push on through the nightThe idea behind the Night Pass is to allow athletes a chance to advance their position by tactical means They may be able to hike to a key point where they can extend their lead or pass teams in front But the price is a missed night of recovery And they can only do this once says Red Bull XAlps race director Christoph WeberAthletes cannot pull the Night Pass spontaneously but will need to announce their intention in advance to the race committee Furthermore they will not know who else is using the card until the race organizers announce this information before the night stage beginsThe Night Pass is not the only change of the 2013 Red Bull XAlps including an additional supporter for teams the adjustment to the mandatory rest period  now 2230 to 0500  and the banning of prototype equipment of any kindAthletes will also be required to carry a Pieps Globalfinder for safety reasonsWinners Year

reflector belt and tracking device must be carried at all times Athletes may choose any route they like but must pass all turnpoints Each athlete has up to two supporters to provide logistical help

Kobiet PK feminist leader Iwona Pitek Overview The transition from a monoparty Communist regime to liberal democracy and pluralism resulted in new political parties mushrooming in the early 1990s After the first free parliamentary elections in 1991 seats in the Sejm were divided among more than a dozen different parties amongst them such curiosities as the Polish BeerLovers Party Polska Partia Przyjaci Piwa led by a popular comedy actor Janusz Rewiski The existence of so many parties in the Sejm was seen by many as being counterproductive to the effectiveness of the parliament and a hindrance towards producing stable governments Consequently electoral reform was undertaken and an electoral threshold for the Lower House was instituted prior to the 1993 elections The set threshold required a minimum vote of 5 for parties with exemptions for ethnic minority parties and 8 for electoral coalitions The threshold was set at the national rather than divisional level and had the effect of preventing a large number of minor parties from winning seats in later elections The threshold also prevented independent candidates from gaining election to the Sejm Since 1990 the left side of the political scene has generally been dominated by former Communists turned social democrats The right has largely comprised former Solidarity activists and supporters but experienced deep divisions from the beginning and showed less cohesiveness than the left The right were unable to create a single bloc which could act as a lasting counterweight to the leftwing monolith but instead kept merging splitting and renaming Even so the parties of the right did manage to win government again from 19972001 having initially governed from 198993 Since the parliamentary elections of 2005 the rightwing parties have dominated the political scene and appear to be in their strongest position to date Two important developments in the political landscape have taken place since 2005 Firstly the SLD Communist successor party is no longer the major or one of the two major parties Secondly the main political battleground is no longer between the exSolidarity right verses the exCommunist left The new competing groupings are those of the Law and Justice party promoting nationalistic and conservative social policies and the Civic Platform representing a more conservativeliberal position The general public disapproval of politics and politicians as a whole has resulted in almost all major parties excluding the very word party from their names replacing it with words less associated with politics such as union platform league or allianceAll political parties and organizations since 1989This is a list of political organizations registered in Poland as political parties societies
