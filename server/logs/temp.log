	19804872, mproved trimethoprim-resistance cassette for prokaryotic selections.Many of the antibiotic resistance elements used in molecular biology have idiosyncratic limitations. For example, beta-lactam selections rely on antibiotics that are unstable to hydrolysis and allow satellite colonies to form upon extended incubation, and tetracycline selections typically give rise to widely varying colony sizes and lower transformation efficiencies. Although prokaryotic Type II dihydrofolate reductase (dfr) genes have long been considered to have potential utility for the selection of plasmids and mobile elements in bacteria, practical limitations to the quality of those selections, mostly relating to background and inefficiency, have led for the most part to their underuse. I describe here the construction of a Type IIa dfr prokaryotic expression cassette that confers strong resistance against trimethoprim (Tmp), a bactericidal dfr inhibiting antibiotic. The Tmp-resistance cassette provides consistent and efficient selections and plasmid transformation frequencies equivalent to those encountered with beta-lactamases

	8893, solation and properties of yeast mutants with highly efficient thymidylate utilization.A screening procedure is presented which allows the isolation of yeast mutants (typ tir) with highly efficient utilization of exogenous deoxythymidine-5'-monophosphate (5'-dTMP) (greater than 50%). Data are given concerning the phenomenon of 5'-dTMP utilization in general: (i) The ability of S. cerevisiae to incorporate exogenous 5'-dTMP was found to already to be a wild type feature of this yeast, i.e. apparently not to be due to any mutation such as typ, tup, tmp, per or tum. Consequently these mutations are interpreted as amplifiers of a pre-given wild type potency. So far eight stages of 5'-dTMP utilization were detected as classified by the optimal 5'-dTMP requirement, with 5'-dTMP biosynthesis blocked, of the corresponding mutant strains isolated. All of them fit well into a mathematical series of the type  2n x 1.5  (n = 0, 1, 2, ..., 11), where the product term for n = 11 represents the 5'-dTMP requirement (mug/ml) of the best 5'-dTMP utilizing wild type strain found. (ii) Amplification of the 5'-dTMP utilizing potency obviously is due to any genetically determined alteration of the yeast 5'-dTMP uptaking principle itself or of physiological processes accompanying the monophosphate's uptake. (iii) The functioning of 5'-dTMP uptake requires acidic (less than or equal to pH 6) conditions in the yeast cell's outer environment. (iv) Some yeast typ and typ tlr mutants were found to exhibit a more or less pronounced sensitivity towards exogenously offered 5'-dTMP. The response of a sensitive strain towards inhibitory concentrations of the nucleotide apparently is co-conditioned by the presence or absence of thymidylate biosynthesis. With 5'-dTMP biosynthesis blocked the 5'-dTMP mediated inhibition is a permanent one and finally leads to the death of a cell. With a functioning thymidylate biosynthesis, in contrast, the inhibition is only temporary. (v) Yeast typ or typ tlr strains were observed to dephosphorylate exogenous 5'-dTMP to thymidine due to a phosphatase activity which cannot be eliminated at pH 7 + 70 mM inorganic phosphate conditions in the growth medium. This 5'-dTMP cleavage obviously occurs outside the cell and does not seem to be correlated both to the monophosphate's uptake and to the phenomenon of 5'-dTMP sensitivity. The destruction of 5'-dTMP does not disturb (5'-dTMP) DNA-specific labelling

CCL4
	12502723, eterologous desensitization of T cell functions by CCR5 and CXCR4 ligands: inhibition of cellular signaling, adhesion and chemotaxis.T cells migrate into inflamed sites through the extracellular matrix (ECM) in response to chemotactic areas and are then simultaneously or sequentially exposed to multiple chemotactic ligands. We examined the responses of human peripheral blood T cells, present in an ECM-like context, to combinatorial signaling transduced by SDF-1alpha (CXCL12), and two CCR5 ligands, RANTES (CCL5) and MIP-1beta (CCL4). Separately, these chemokines, at G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-stimulating concentrations, induced T cell adhesion to fibronectin (FN) and T cell chemotaxis. However, the pro-adhesive and pro-migratory capacities of SDF-1alpha and RANTES or MIP-1beta were mutually suppressed by the simultaneous or sequential exposure of the cells to these CCR5 or CXCR4 ligands. This cross-talk did not involve the internalization of the SDF-1alpha receptor, CXCR4, but rather, a decrease in phosphorylation of ERK and Pyk-2, as well as inhibition of Ca(2+) mobilization. Strikingly, early CXCR4 signaling of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, detected by SDF-1alpha-induced AKT phosphorylation, was insensitive to RANTES-CCR5 signals. Accordingly, early chemotaxis to SDF-1alpha was not susceptible to CCR5 occupancy, whereas late stages of T cell chemotaxis were markedly down-regulated. This is an example of a specialized functional desensitization of heterologous chemokine receptors that induces GPCR interference with T cell adhesion to ECM ligands and chemotaxis within chemokine-rich extravascular contexts

	12634395, nterleukin-7-dependent production of RANTES that correlates with human immunodeficiency virus disease progression.There is a relationship between CD4-T-cell number and circulating interleukin 7 (IL-7) levels in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals. Here, we show that IL-7 induced a dose-dependent production of CCL3 (MIP-1alpha), CCL4 (MIP-1beta), and CCL5 (RANTES) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), ex vivo tonsil lymphoid tissue of HIV(-) individuals, and PBMC from HIV(+) individuals, suggesting that IL-7 may regulate beta-chemokine production in vivo. In a cross-sectional study of HIV(+) individuals (n = 130), a weak but significant correlation between IL-7 and RANTES was noted (r = 0.379; P &lt; 0.001). Remarkably, the correlation between IL-7 and RANTES increased to an r value of 0.798 (P &lt; 0.001) if individuals with low CD4 cell counts (&lt;200 cells/ micro l) were excluded from the analysis. Our results suggest that there is a relationship between IL-7 and the production of RANTES both in vitro and in vivo that is lost in immune-compromised patients (CD4 count of &lt;200 cells/ micro l) but that could be restored by antiretroviral therapy. Unlike the case for IL-7, high levels of RANTES suggest an intermediate stage of HIV disease progression

	12651610, athepsin D specifically cleaves the chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta, and SLC that are expressed in human breast cancer.Cathepsin D (Cath-D) expression in human primary breast cancer has been associated with a poor prognosis. In search of a better understanding of the Cath-D substrates possibly involved in cancer invasiveness and metastasis, we investigated the potential interactions between this protease and chemokines. Here we report that purified Cath-D, as well as culture supernatants from the human breast carcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and T47D, selectively degrade macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha (CCL3), MIP-1 beta (CCL4), and SLC (CCL21). Proteolysis was totally blocked by the protease inhibitor pepstatin A, and specificity of Cath-D cleavage was demonstrated using a large chemokine panel. Whereas MIP-1 alpha and MIP-1 beta degradation was rapid and complete, cleavage of SLC was slow and not complete. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that Cath-D cleaves the Leu(58) to Trp(59) bond of SLC producing two functionally inactive fragments. Analysis of Cath-D proteolysis of a series of monocyte chemoattractant protein-3/MIP-1 beta hybrids indicated that processing of MIP-1 beta might start by cleaving off amino acids located in the C-terminal domain. In situ hybridization studies revealed MIP-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta, and Cath-D gene expression mainly in the stromal compartment of breast cancers whereas SLC transcripts were found in endothelial cells of capillaries and venules within the neoplastic tissues. Cath-D production in the breast carcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and T47D, as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of culture supernatants and cell lysates, was not affected by stimulation with chemokines such as interleukin-8 (CXCL8), SDF-1 (CXCL12), and SLC. These data suggest that inactivation of chemokines by Cath-D possibly influences regulatory mechanisms in the tumoral extracellular microenvironment that in turn may affect the generation of the antitumoral immune response, the migration of cancer cells, or both processes

	12651617, otential interaction between CCR1 and its ligand, CCL3, induced by endogenously produced interleukin-1 in human hepatomas.Hepatoma cell lines can produce a massive amount of chemokines in response to various stimuli including hepatitis viruses and their products. However, it remains elusive on the types of chemokine receptor(s) expressed in the hepatoma tissues and its roles in hepatoma development. To clarify these points, we examined the chemokine receptor expression in six human hepatoma cell lines. All of the hepatoma cell lines constitutively and exclusively expressed CCR1 mRNA and its protein on their cell surface. CCR1 expression was also detected on hepatoma cells and to a lesser degree, on endothelial cells in hepatoma tissues but not in normal liver tissues. Furthermore, CCL3 expression was detected in hepatoma cells, endothelial cells, and to a lesser degree, fibroblast-like cells in hepatoma tissue, whereas only occasional vascular endothelial cells and inflammatory cells in normal liver tissues were weakly positive for CCL3. Moreover, the forskolin-mediated increases in intracellular cAMP concentrations were inhibited by the ligands for CCR1, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5, suggesting that the expressed CCR1 was functional. Four hepatoma cell lines produced CCL3 only in response to interleukin (IL)-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. Finally, IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta were detected abundantly in hepatoma tissues but not in normal liver tissues. Thus, IL-1 may enhance the local production of CCL3, which may interact with CCR1 expressed on hepatoma cells, in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner

	12704138, C chemokines mediate leukocyte trafficking into the central nervous system during murine neurocysticercosis: role of gamma delta T cells in amplification of the host immune response.According to a previous report, the degree of the host immune response highly correlates with severity of the disease in the murine model for neurocysticercosis. In wild-type mice, Mesocestoides corti infection induced a rapid and extensive accumulation of gamma delta T cells and macrophages in the brain. NK cells, dendritic cells, alpha beta T cells, and B cells were also recruited to the brain but at lower levels. In contrast, gamma delta T-cell-deficient mice exhibited decreased cellular infiltration and reduced central nervous system (CNS) pathology. To understand the mechanisms of leukocyte recruitment into the CNS, chemokine expression was analyzed in infected brains in the present study. MCP-1 (CCL2), MIP-1 alpha (CCL3), and MIP-1 beta (CCL4) were up-regulated within 2 days after M. corti infection. Protein expression of RANTES (CCL5), eotaxin (CCL11), and MIP-2 was detected later, at 1 week postinfection. Correlating with the decreased cellular infiltration, delta chain T-cell receptor-deficient (TCR delta(-/-)) mice exhibited substantially reduced levels of most of the chemokines analyzed (with the exception of eotaxin). The results suggest that gamma delta T cells play an important role in the CNS immune response by producing chemokines such as MCP-1 and MIP-1 alpha, enhancing leukocyte trafficking into the brain during murine neurocysticercosis

	12960284, rostaglandin E2 inhibits production of the inflammatory chemokines CCL3 and CCL4 in dendritic cells.Dendritic cells bridge innate and adaptive immunity and participate in both responses. Upon capture of pathogens, dendritic cells release inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, attracting other immune cells to the infection site. Anti-inflammatory cytokines, glucocorticoids, anti-inflammatory neuropeptides, and lipid mediators such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) limit and control the inflammatory response. In this study we report that exogenous PGE2 inhibits CCL3 (MIP-1alpha) and CCL4 (MIP-1beta) expression and release from dendritic cells stimulated with either lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a TLR4 ligand, or peptidoglycan, a TLR2 ligand. The inhibition is dose-dependent and occurs at both the mRNA and protein levels. The inhibitory effect is mediated through EP2 and EP4 receptors and requires the presence of PGE2 at the time of LPS stimulation. Intraperitoneal administration of PGE2 together with LPS results in a reduction in the levels of CCL3 and CCL4 released in the peritoneal fluid, a reduction in the number of dendritic cells accumulating in the peritoneal cavity, and a reduction in CCL3 amount per cell in the peritoneal cell population. These results suggest that one of the mechanisms by which endogenous PGE2 acts as an anti-inflammatory agent, is the inhibition of inflammatory chemokine release from activated dendritic cells, preventing the excess accumulation of activated immune cells

	14597406, nhibition of chemokine receptor function by membrane cholesterol oxidation.Membrane cholesterol is required to maintain chemokine receptor conformation and function for CXCR4 and CCR5. We previously demonstrated that chemokines preferentially bind to receptors within lipid rafts, which are cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains. To further elucidate the role of cholesterol in chemokine receptor function, we examined the effects of membrane cholesterol oxidation by cholesterol oxidase (CO), which enzymatically converts cholesterol to 4-cholesten-3-one. Here, we demonstrate that CO treatment (0.25-2.0 U/ml) of human T cells inhibits CXCL12 (SDF-1alpha) and CCL4 (MIP-1beta) binding to cell surface CXCR4 and CCR5, respectively, resulting in the inhibition of chemokine-mediated intracellular calcium mobilization and chemotaxis. The effects were significantly enhanced by cotreatment with low-dose sphingomyelinase (SMase) (0.125 mU/ml), which produced little inhibitory effect by itself. CO and SMase treatment also inhibited HIV-1 infection through CXCR4, but not virus replication. Similar to the removal of membrane cholesterol, CO/SMase treatment induced conformation changes in the chemokine receptors as detected by differential loss in binding of epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies. We conclude that the native form of cholesterol with the hydroxyl group at C3 is critical to CXCR4 and CCR5 conformation and function

	14673550, ndependent expression of the two paralogous CCL4 genes in monocytes and B lymphocytes.The CCL4 chemokine is secreted by a variety of cells following stimulation. CCL4 affects several different types of cells that are important for acute inflammatory responses and are critical for the development of specific immune responses to foreign antigens. The human genome contains two genes for the CCL4 chemokine. Although highly homologous, the two genes encode slightly different proteins. We analyzed the mRNA expressed in monocytes and B lymphocytes and found that while monocytes express predominantly one CCL4 gene, known as ACT-2, peripheral blood B lymphocytes express a mixture of ACT-2 and the second CCL4 gene, lymphocyte activating gene-1 ( LAG-1). Although peripheral blood B cells, CD27(-) B cells, and CD27(+) B cells all express a mixture of LAG-1 and ACT-2, the B-cell lines that were studied regulate the two genes independently. RL, SU-DHL-6, and REH cells predominantly express LAG-1. These studies demonstrate that monocytes and B cells utilize different mechanisms to regulate expression of the two CCL4 genes and suggest that the two genes may not have identical activities

	14735149, vidence for a cluster of genes on chromosome 17q11-q21 controlling susceptibility to tuberculosis and leprosy in Brazilians.The region of conserved synteny on mouse chromosome 11/human 17q11-q21 is known to carry a susceptibility gene(s) for intramacrophage pathogens. The region is rich in candidates including NOS2A, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1alpha, CCL4/MIP-1beta, CCL5/RANTES, CCR7, STAT3 and STAT5A/5B. To examine the region in man, we studied 92 multicase tuberculosis (627 individuals) and 72 multicase leprosy (372 individuals) families from Brazil. Multipoint nonparametric analysis (ALLEGRO) using 16 microsatellites shows two peaks of linkage for leprosy at D17S250 (Z(lr) score 2.34; P=0.01) and D17S1795 (Z(lr) 2.67; P=0.004) and a single peak for tuberculosis at D17S250 (Z(lr) 2.04; P=0.02). Combined analysis shows significant linkage (peak Z(lr) 3.38) at D17S250, equivalent to an allele sharing LOD score 2.48 (P=0.0004). To determine whether one or multiple genes contribute, 49 informative single nucleotide polymorphisms were typed in candidate genes. Family-based allelic association testing that was robust to family clustering demonstrated significant associations with tuberculosis susceptibility at four loci separated by intervals (NOS2A-8.4 Mb-CCL18-32.3 kb-CCL4-6.04 Mb-STAT5B) up to several Mb. Stepwise conditional logistic regression analysis using a case/pseudo-control data set showed that the four genes contributed separate main effects, consistent with a cluster of susceptibility genes across 17q11.2

	14761932, educed GRK2 level in T cells potentiates chemotaxis and signaling in response to CCL4.Chemokine receptors belong to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). Phosphorylation of GPCR by GPCR kinases (GRKs) is considered to play an important role in desensitization of these receptors. We have recently shown in patients with rheumatoid arthritis that the level of GRK2 in lymphocytes is reduced by approximately 50%. However, the physiological relevance of reduced GRK2 levels in lymphocytes is not known. Here, we investigated whether reduced GRK2 expression changes the chemotactic response of T cells to the chemokines CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5. Activated T cells from GRK2+/- mice, which have a 50% reduction in GRK2 protein levels, showed a significant 40% increase in chemotaxis toward the CCR5 ligand CCL4. In addition, chemotaxis toward the CCR1 and CCR5 ligands CCL3 and CCL5 was also increased. Binding of CCL4 to activated T cells from GRK2+/- and wild-type (WT) mice was similar, but agonist-induced CCR5 phosphorylation was attenuated in GRK2+/- cells. Moreover, the calcium response and phosphorylation of protein kinase B and extracellular-regulated kinase in response to CCL4 were significantly increased in GRK2+/- T cells, showing that signaling is increased when the level of GRK2 is reduced. GRK2+/- and WT cells do become refractory to restimulation with CCL4. In conclusion, a 50% decrease in T cell GRK2 expression results in increased responsiveness to CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5, suggesting that the 50% reduction in lymphocyte GRK2 level as observed during inflammation can have functional consequences for the response of these cells to chemokines

	15095403, mino-terminal processing of MIP-1beta/CCL4 by CD26/dipeptidyl-peptidase IV.CD26 is a membrane-bound ectopeptidase with dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) activity that has diverse functional properties in T cell physiology and in regulation of bioactive peptides. We have previously reported that activated human peripheral lymphocytes (PBL) secrete an amino-terminal truncated form of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1beta/(3-69) with novel functional specificity for CCR1, 2, and 5. In this report, we show that the full length MIP-1beta is processed by CD26/DPPIV to the truncated form and that cleavage can be blocked by DPPIV inhibitory peptides derived from HIV Tat(1-9) or the thromboxane A2 receptor, TAX2-R(1-9). Addition of Tat(1-9) or TAX2-R(1-9) peptides to PBL cultures partially blocks endogenous MIP-1beta processing. The kinetics of conversion of MIP-1beta from intact to MIP-1beta(3-69) in activated PBLs correlates with cell surface expression of CD26. Our results suggest that NH2-terminal processing of MIP-1beta and possibly other chemokines may depend on the balance between CD26/DPPIV enzymatic activity and cellular and viral proteins that modulate enzyme function

	15099025, he beta chemokines CCL4 and CCL5 enhance adhesion of specific CD4+ T cell subsets to human brain endothelial cells.Chemokines are key mediators of inflammation, acting as subset-specific chemoattractants and activators of leukocytes. In the present study we investigated the effects of chemokine concentration gradients on CD4+ T cell (TC4) adhesion to human brain microvessel endothelial cells (HBMECs) in vitro. CCL4 or CCL5 were placed in a double chamber chemotaxis system beneath confluent resting HBMEC monolayers or cultures co-incubated with TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma to mimic an inflammatory milieu. Chemokines readily diffused across activated HBMEC monolayers while binding to the sub-endothelial regions, establishing a chemotactic and haptotactic gradient. Naïve or resting TC4 adhered poorly to resting HBMECs compared to memory or recently activated TC4, but all subsets adhered more readily to cytokine-treated HBMECs. Chemokine gradients (10-100 ng/ml) of both CCL4 and CCL5 significantly enhanced the adhesion of memory and recently activated TC4 to cytokine-treated HBMECs, as much as doubling adhesion in a manner that correlated with chemokine receptor expression. Neither chemokine influenced adhesion to resting HBMEC monolayers nor the adhesion of resting or naïve TC4. These findings emphasize the role and importance of CNS-derived beta-chemokines in regulating the traffic of recently activated TC subsets (those previously localized to the CNS in vivo) across cytokine-activated cerebral endothelium in inflammatory diseases

	15122175, ack of good correlation of serum CC-chemokine levels with human immunodeficiency virus-1 disease stage and response to treatment.Three CC-chemokines-MIP-1alpha (CCL3), MIP-1beta (CCL4), and RANTES (CCL5)-are natural ligands for the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) coreceptor CCR5. To determine correlations between CC-chemokines and HIV-1 disease stage or response to treatment, we examined serum levels of MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES in 60 infected patients during 18 months while they were taking highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Our results demonstrate that serum levels of MIP-1alpha and RANTES were increased in HIV-1-infected individuals compared with those in healthy controls. We found no significant differences among 4 clinical stages of HIV-1 infection in the serum levels of three CC-chemokines. Longitudinal HAART analyses revealed a pronounced decline in serum MIP-1alpha levels over time. We found no difference in this decline between HAART responders and nonresponders. These findings indicate that production of MIP-1alpha and RANTES changes during HIV-1 infection and treatment; however, our results suggest that serum levels of CC-chemokines should not be used as biomarkers for HIV-1 disease stage or response to treatment

	15122808, nhibition of respiratory syncytial virus infection with the CC chemokine RANTES (CCL5).Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of respiratory tract disease in infants, aged adults, and immunosuppressed patients. The only approved medicines for RSV disease are administration of prophylatic antibodies or treatment with a synthetic nucleoside. Both approaches are expensive and the latter is not without risk and of controversial benefit. The present investigation studied whether pharmaceutical or biologic compounds based upon chemokines might be useful in preventing RSV disease. Of interest was RANTES/CCL5, which inhibits infection by HIV strains that use chemokine receptor (CCR)-5 as co-receptor. Herein, we report that prior or simultaneous treatment of HEp-2 cells with recombinant human CCL5 provides dose-dependent inhibition of infection with RSV. Other recombinant chemokines (MIP-1alpha/CCL3, MIP-1beta/CCL4, MCP-2/CCL8, eotaxin/CCL11, MIP-1delta/CCL15, stromal cell derived factor (SDF)-1alpha/CXCL12) were not inhibitory. The data suggested that CCL5 might inhibit infection by blocking fusion (F) protein-epithelial cell interactions. Infections by mutant RSV strains deleted of small hydrophobic and/or attachment proteins and only expressing F protein in the envelope were inhibited by prior treatment with CCL5 or a biologically inactive N-terminally modified met-CCL5. Inhibition was also observed when virus adsorption and treatment with CCL5 were performed at 4 degrees C. Flow cytometry further revealed that epithelial cells were positive for CCR3, but not CCR1 or CCR5. Thus, novel mimetics of CCL5 may be useful prophylatic agents to prevent respiratory tract disease caused by RSV

	15178708, -TAC/CXCL11 is a natural antagonist for CCR5.The selective CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) agonists, monokine induced by interferon-gamma (IFN- gamma)/CXC chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9), IFN-inducible protein 10/CXCL10, and IFN-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC)/CXCL11, attract CXCR3+ cells such as CD45RO+ T lymphocytes, B cells, and natural killer cells. Further, all three chemokines are potent, natural antagonists for chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3) and feature defensin-like, antimicrobial activities. In this study, we show that I-TAC, in addition to these effects, acts as an antagonist for CCR5. I-TAC inhibited the binding of macrophage-inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha)/CC chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3) to cells transfected with CCR5 and to monocytes. Furthermore, cell migration evoked by regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES)/CCL5 and MIP-1beta/CCL4, the selective agonist of CCR5, was inhibited in transfected cells and monocytes, respectively. In two other functional assays, namely the release of free intracellular calcium and actin polymerization, I-TAC reduced CCR5 activities to minimal levels. Sequence and structure analyses indicate a potential role for K17, K49, and Q51 of I-TAC in CCR5 binding. Our results expand on the potential role of I-TAC as a negative modulator in leukocyte migration and activation, as I-TAC would specifically counteract the responses mediated by many  classical,  inflammatory chemokines that act not only via CCR3 but via CCR5 as well

	15203102, acrophage inflammatory protein-1.Macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha was identified 15 years ago as the first of now four members of the MIP-1 CC chemokine subfamily. These proteins termed CCL3 (MIP-1alpha), CCL4 (MIP-1beta), CCL9/10 (MIP-1delta), and CCL15 (MIP-1gamma) according to the revised nomenclature for chemokines are produced by many cells, particularly macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes. MIP-1 proteins, which act via G-protein-coupled cell surface receptors (CCR1, 3, 5), e.g. expressed by lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages (MPhi), are best known for their chemotactic and proinflammatory effects but can also promote homoeostasis. The encouraging results of preclinical studies in murine models of inflammation, i.e. asthma, arthritis, or multiple sclerosis, have led to the development of potent CCR3 and 5 antagonists, some of which are currently being tested in first clinical trials

	15204927, xpression of chemokines by human fetal microglia after treatment with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protein Tat.Chemokines are important mediators of inflammation. It has been demonstrated that there is an increase in chemokine expression in both the sera and brain of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The HIV-1 viral protein, Tat, a transcriptional regulator, has been detected in the central nervous system (CNS) of infected individuals, and has been demonstrated to induce chemokines from various cells within the brain. The authors now show that the interaction of human microglia, the resident phagocytes of the brain, with Tat leads to dramatic increases in the secretion of the chemokines CCL2, CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5. Treatment of microglia with Tat plus specific inhibitors of signal transduction pathways demonstrated that the induction of each chemokine is regulated differently. Tat-induced expression of CCL2 and CCL4 was mediated by the activation of the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, whereas the induction of CXCL8 and CCL3 was mediated only by the p38 MAPK pathway. Tat-induced CXCL10 expression was mediated, to some extent, by activation of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, and the p38 MAPK pathway, whereas CCL5 expression was not mediated by any pathway tested. Western blot analysis demonstrated phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 and Akt upon stimulation of microglia with Tat. These data suggest that a soluble HIV-1 viral protein can alter the chemokine balance in the brain, which can then lead to an influx of inflammatory cells and contribute to the neuropathogenesis of HIV-1 infection

	15240137, unctional redundancy of the human CCL4 and CCL4L1 chemokine genes.CCL4 and CCL4L1 are two CC chemokine genes located at chromosome 17q21 whose mature proteins differ at only a single amino acid. Abundant functional information exists for CCL4, however, CCL4L1 has only recently been recognized as a distinct gene, thus information describing it is wanting. The CCL4L1 protein was synthesized in Escherichia coli and compared with the CCL4 protein. Competitive binding studies using HEK-293/CCR5 cells produced comparable EC50 values for the two proteins. Similarly, chemotaxis assays with cells expressing CCR1, CCR3, or CCR5 revealed no substantial differences. CCL4L1 was somewhat more effective at inhibiting HIV-1 replication in PBMCs than was CCL4, however the difference was not statistically significant. These data combined with the observation of individual variation in CCL4L1 gene copy number [Eur. J. Immunol. 32 (2002) 3016, Genomics 83 (2004) 735] support the contention that the CCL4 and CCL4L1 proteins have redundant functions

	15498767,  novel signaling pathway mediates the inhibition of CCL3/4 expression by prostaglandin E2.In response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns, dendritic cells initiate an innate immune response characterized by expression and release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The extent of the inflammatory response is limited by various endogenous factors, including lipid mediators such as prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)). We described previously the inhibitory effect of PGE(2) on the expression and release of the inflammatory chemokines CCL3 and CCL4 from activated dendritic cells. In this study we describe a novel PGE(2) signaling pathway that proceeds through EP-2 --&gt; cAMP --&gt; EPAC --&gt; phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase --&gt; protein kinase B --&gt; GSK-3 and results in increased DNA binding of the CCAAT displacement protein (CDP), a potent mammalian transcriptional repressor. The direct link between CDP and CCL3/4 transcription was established in knock-down experiments using CDP small interference RNA

	15546882, C and CX3C chemokines differentially interact with the N terminus of the human cytomegalovirus-encoded US28 receptor.Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the causative agent of life-threatening systemic diseases in immunocompromised patients as well as a risk factor for vascular pathologies, like atherosclerosis, in immunocompetent individuals. HCMV encodes a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), referred to as US28, that displays homology to the human chemokine receptor CCR1 and binds several chemokines of the CC family as well as the CX3C chemokine fractalkine with high affinity. Most importantly, following HCMV infection, US28 activates several intracellular pathways, either constitutively or in a chemokine-dependent manner. In this study, our goal was to understand the molecular interactions between chemokines and the HCMV-encoded US28 receptor. To achieve this goal, a double approach has been used, consisting in the analysis of both receptor and ligand mutants. This approach has led us to identify several amino acids located in the N terminus of US28 that differentially contribute to the high affinity binding of CC versus CX3C chemokines. Additionally, our results highlight the importance of secondary modifications occurring at US28, such as sulfation, for ligand recognition. Finally, the effects of chemokine dimerization and interaction with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on chemokine binding and activation of US28 were investigated as well using CCL4 as model ligand. In line with the two-state model describing chemokine/receptor interaction, we show that an aromatic residue in the N-loop region of CCL4 promotes tight binding to US28, whereas receptor activation depends on the presence of the N terminus of CCL4, as shown previously for CCR5

	15567066, CL3 (MIP-1alpha) induces in vitro migration of GM-CSF-primed human neutrophils via CCR5-dependent activation of ERK 1/2.CCL3 (MIP-1alpha), a prototype of CC chemokines, is a potent chemoattractant toward human neutrophils pre-treated with GM-CSF for 15 min. GM-CSF-treated neutrophils migrate also to the selective CCR5 agonist CCL4 (MIP-1beta). CCL3- and CCL4-triggered migration of GM-CSF-primed neutrophils was inhibited by the CCR5 antagonist TAK-779. Accordingly, freshly isolated neutrophils express CCR5. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)-1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors blocked CCL3-induced migration of GM-CSF-primed neutrophils. When the activation of ERK-1/2 and p38 MAPK by CCL3 and the classical neutrophilic chemokine CXCL8 (IL-8) were compared, both the chemokines were capable of activating p38 MAPK. On the contrary, whereas both ERK-1 and ERK-2 were activated by CXCL8, no ERK-1 band was detectable after CCL3 triggering. Finally, neutrophil pre-treatment with GM-CSF activated both ERK-1 and ERK-2. This suggests that by activating ERK-1, GM-CSF renders neutrophils rapidly responsive to CCL3 stimulation throughout CCR5 which is constitutively expressed on the cell surface

	15577536, ew CCR5 variants associated with reduced HIV coreceptor function in southeast Asia.BACKGROUND: Despite multiple exposure to HIV-1, some individuals remain uninfected. This resistance has been associated with homozygosity for a 32 base pair deletion in the gene for the CCR5 receptor. This variant occurs frequently in Caucasians but is extremely rare in Asians or Africans. OBJECTIVE: To identify variations in CCR5 receptor gene that affect susceptibility to HIV infection in non-Caucasians. METHODS: CCR5 coding region polymorphisms were screened in three groups of Vietnamese subjects: 47 HIV-1 infected intravascular drug users, 50 highly HIV-1-exposed but seronegative intravascular drug users and 37 HIV-1-unexposed seronegative individuals. DNA was analysed by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography; this was followed by examination of the biochemical and HIV coreceptor properties of the coding regions. RESULTS: Five CCR5 coding region variants were identified in this Vietnamese population. The S185R, I254T and C269F mutations have not been previously described; G106R and R223Q have already been found in other Asian populations, but the functional properties of G106R is not known. These variants differed in biochemical and HIV coreceptor properties. S185R and I254T variants had receptor and coreceptor activities comparable to that of the wild type, whereas C269F and G106R behaved differently. This latter pair are poorly expressed at the cell surface, weakly bind macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta (CCL4) and RANTES (CCL5), and display reduced HIV-1 coreceptor efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Among the five CCR5 variants found in this Vietnamese population, G106R and C269F displayed significant modifications of their receptor and coreceptor properties, which may contribute to susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and/or disease progression within this population

	15634923, nnate immunity in the human female reproductive tract: antiviral response of uterine epithelial cells to the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C).The objective of this study was to examine the expression of TLR by human primary uterine epithelial cells (UEC) and to determine whether exposure to the TLR agonist poly(I:C) would induce an antiviral response. The secretion of several cytokines and chemokines was examined as well as the mRNA expression of human beta-defensin-1 and -2 (HBD1 and HBD2), IFN-beta, and the IFN-beta-stimulated genes myxovirus resistance gene 1 and 2',5' oligoadenylate synthetase. The expression of TLR1-9 by UEC was demonstrated by RT-PCR, with only TLR10 not expressed. Stimulation of UEC with the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C) induced the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-6, GM-CSF, and G-CSF, as well as the chemokines CXCL8/IL-8, CCL2/MCP-1, and CCL4/MIP-1beta. In addition, poly(I:C) exposure induced the mRNA expression of HBD1 and HBD2 by 6- and 4-fold, respectively. Furthermore, upon exposure to poly(I:C) UEC initiated a potent antiviral response resulting in the induction of IFN-beta mRNA expression 70-fold and myxovirus resistance gene 1 and 2',5' oligoadenylate synthetase mRNA expression (107- and 96-fold), respectively. These results suggest that epithelial cells that line the uterine cavity are sensitive to viral infection and/or exposure to viral dsRNA released from killed epithelial cells. Not only do UEC release proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that mediate the initiation of an inflammatory response and recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection, but they also express beta-defensins, IFN-beta, and IFN-beta-stimulated genes that can have a direct inhibiting effect on viral replication

	15655788, CR5 plays a critical role in the development of myocarditis and host protection in mice infected with Trypanosoma cruzi.The pathogenesis of myocarditis during Trypanosoma cruzi infection is poorly understood. We investigated the role played by chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) in the influx of T cells to the cardiac tissue of T. cruzi-infected mice. mRNA and protein for the CCR5 ligands CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 were detected in the hearts of infected mice in association with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. There was a high level of CCR5 expression on CD8+ T cells in the hearts of infected mice. Moreover, CCR5 expression on CD8+ T cells was positively modulated by T. cruzi infection. CCR5-deficient mice infected with T. cruzi experienced a dramatically inhibited migration of T cells to the heart and were also more susceptible to infection. These results suggest that CCR5 and its ligands play a central role in the control of T cell influx in T. cruzi-infected mice. Knowledge of the mechanisms that trigger and control the migration of cells to the heart in patients with Chagas disease may help in the design of drugs that prevent myocarditis and protect against the development of severe disease

	15742158, ot all tetramer binding CD8+ T cells can produce cytokines and chemokines involved in the effector functions of virus-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes in HIV-1 infected children.In the pediatric human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection, the presence of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) is associated with a slow progression to AIDS. The secretion of cytokines by CTLs may be critical in the control of viral infection. We used the combination of cell surface and intracellular staining to study the functionality of tetramer binding CD8+ T cells recognizing two HIV-1 immunodominant epitopes, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV-1-infected children. A fraction of tetramer positive CD8+ T cells produce cytokines (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) or chemokines (CCL4, CCL5) after ex vivo stimulation with the cognate peptide. There was a negative correlation between the plasma viral load and the percentage of CD8+ Tetramer Gag+ T cells secreting IFN-gamma. This is the first report in the context of pediatric HIV-1 infection showing that only a fraction of HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells have the capacity to produce cytokines and chemokines implicated in their antiviral functions

	15831559, IP-1alpha[CCL3] acting on the CCR1 receptor mediates neutrophil migration in immune inflammation via sequential release of TNF-alpha and LTB4.In the present study, we investigated the involvement of macrophage-inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha)[CC chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3)], MIP-1beta[CCL4], regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES)[CCL5], and CC chemokine receptors (CCRs) on neutrophil migration in murine immune inflammation. Previously, we showed that ovalbumin (OVA)-triggered neutrophil migration in immunized mice depends on the sequential release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and leukotriene B(4)(LTB(4)). Herein, we show increased mRNA expression for MIP-1alpha[CCL3], MIP-1beta[CCL4], RANTES[CCL5], and CCR1 in peritoneal cells harvested from OVA-challenged, immunized mice, as well as MIP-1alpha[CCL3] and RANTES[CCL5] but not MIP-1beta[CCL4] proteins in the peritoneal exudates. OVA-induced neutrophil migration response was muted in immunized MIP-1alpha[CCL3](-/-) mice, but it was not inhibited by treatment with antibodies against RANTES[CCL5] or MIP-1beta[CCL4]. MIP-1alpha[CCL3] mediated neutrophil migration in immunized mice through induction of TNF-alpha and LTB(4) synthesis, as these mediators were detected in the exudates harvested from OVA-challenged immunized wild-type but not MIP-1alpha[CCL3](-/-) mice; administration of MIP-1alpha[CCL3] induced a dose-dependent neutrophil migration, which was inhibited by treatment with an anti-TNF-alpha antibody in TNF receptor 1 (p55(-/-))-deficient mice or by MK 886 (a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor); and MIP-1alpha[CCL3] failed to induce LTB(4) production in p55(-/-) mice. MIP-1alpha[CCL3] used CCR1 to promote neutrophil recruitment, as OVA or MIP-1alpha[CCL3] failed to induce neutrophil migration in CCR1(-/-) mice, in contrast to CCR5(-/-) mice. In summary, we have demonstrated that neutrophil migration observed in this model of immune inflammation is mediated by MIP-1alpha[CCL3], which via CCR1, induces the sequential release of TNF-alpha and LTB(4). Therefore, whether a similar pathway mediates neutrophil migration in human immune-inflammatory diseases, the development of specific CCR1 antagonists might have a therapeutic potential

	15843566, ultiple products derived from two CCL4 loci: high incidence of a new polymorphism in HIV+ patients.Human CCL4/macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1beta and CCL3/MIP-1alpha are two highly related molecules that belong to a cluster of inflammatory CC chemokines located in chromosome 17. CCL4 and CCL3 were formed by duplication of a common ancestral gene, generating the SCYA4 and SCYA3 genes which, in turn, present a variable number of additional non-allelic copies (SCYA4L and SCYA3L1). In this study, we show that both CCL4 loci (SCYA4 and SCYA4L) are expressed and alternatively generate spliced variants lacking the second exon. In addition, we found that the SCYA4L locus is polymorphic and displays a second allelic variant (hereinafter SCYA4L2) with a nucleotide change in the intron 2 acceptor splice site compared with the one described originally (hereinafter SCYA4L1). Therefore, the pattern of SCYA4L2 transcripts is completely different from that of SCYA4L1, since SCYA4L2 uses several new acceptor splice sites and generates nine new mRNAs. Furthermore, we analyzed the contribution of each locus (SCYA4 and SCYA4L1/L2) to total CCL4 expression in human CD8 T cells by RT-amplified fragment length polymorphism and real-time PCR, and we found that L2 homozygous individuals (L2L2) only express half the levels of CCL4 compared with L1L1 individuals. The analysis of transcripts from the SCYA4L locus showed a lower level in L2 homozygous compared with L1 homozygous individuals (12% vs 52% of total CCL4 transcripts). A possible clinical relevance of these CCL4 allelic variants was suggested by the higher frequency of the L2 allele in a group of HIV(+) individuals (n = 175) when compared with controls (n = 220, 28.6% vs 16.6% (p = 0.00016))

	15851912, iochemical and HIV-1 coreceptor properties of K26R, a new CCR5 Variant in China's Sichuan population.Despite multiple exposures to HIV-1, some individuals remain uninfected. This resistance to HIV infection has been associated with homozygosity for a 32-basepair deletion in the CCR5 receptor gene. This variant is frequent in caucasians but extremely rare in Asians and Africans. Identifying variations in the CCR5 gene that affect susceptibility to HIV infection in non-caucasians is therefore of great interest. In this report, we identify 5 CCR5 coding region variants in a Chinese population. The K26R mutation is an undescribed gene variant, whereas 228delK was already found in caucasians and G106R, C178R, and R223Q were previously described in Asian populations and functionally analyzed. As the function of K26R was still unknown, we focused our work on studying its chemokine receptor activity and HIV coreceptor properties compared with wild-type CCR5 and G106R, an already analyzed mutant taken as another control. We observed that K26R displayed alteration in MIP1-beta/CCL4 and RANTES/CCL5 ligand binding and exhibited a slightly decrease for HIV coreceptor properties

	15867499, nfluence of the R22H variant of macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta/Lag-1 in HIV-1 survival.The chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta/CCL4, ligand of the major HIV co-receptor CCR5, is encoded by two genes, Act-2 and Lag-1. Our work focused on R22H, a variant of Lag-1 located near the N-loop, in the 310 turn, a domain essential for interacting with CCR5. We observed that HIV-1-infected patients from the SEROCO cohort, bearing the R22H variant either at the homozygous or heterozygous state, exhibit a worse global survival compared with wild-type homozygous individuals

	15879095, strogen regulates CCR gene expression and function in T lymphocytes.Estrogen has been implicated in the observed female bias in autoimmune diseases. However, the mechanisms behind this gender dimorphism are poorly defined. We have previously reported that in vivo T cell trafficking is gender- and estrogen-dependent. Chemokine receptors are critical determinants of T cell homing and immune response. In this study, we show that the female gender is associated with increased CD4(+) T cell CCR1-CCR5 gene and protein expression in mice. The increased CCR expression correlates with enhanced in vitro chemotaxis response to MIP-1beta (CCL4). In vivo treatment of young oophorectomized and postmenopausal female mice with 17beta-estradiol also increased CD4(+) T cell CCR expression. Finally, 17beta-estradiol enhances tyrosine phosphorylation in T cells stimulated with MIP-1alpha in a time-dependent manner. Our results indicate an important role of estrogen in determining T cell chemokine response that may help explain the increased susceptibility and severity of autoimmune diseases in females

	15879106, pG-independent synergistic induction of beta-chemokines and a dendritic cell phenotype by orthophosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in elutriated human primary monocytes.Chemokines attract leukocytes bearing the relevant chemokine receptors and regulate innate immune responses. CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) and GM-CSF are potent vaccine adjuvants and in combination induce enhanced Th1 responses by mechanisms yet to be determined. We have examined combinations of CpG- or non-CpG-ODN and GM-CSF for effects on the production of chemokines and the differentiation of monocytes to dendritic cells. High levels of the Th1-attracting, HIV-1-inhibitory chemokines, CCL3/MIP-1alpha and CCL4/MIP-1beta, were induced in human primary monocytes when CpG- or non-CpG-ODN was combined with GM-CSF, but not with IL-4 or IFN-gamma. The synergistic induction of beta-chemokines by non-CpG-ODN was phosphorothioate (PS) chemistry dependent and inhibited by blocking endosome maturation/acidification and ERK1/2 activation. Chemokine and TLR9 mRNAs were induced by PS-ODN. Cells treated with non-CpG PS-ODN and GM-CSF expressed dendritic cell marker CD83 and high levels of HLA-DR and costimulatory molecules, and were CD14(-) or CD14(dim), consistent with monocyte differentiation into a dendritic cell phenotype. The induction of CD83 and beta-chemokines was tyrosine phosphorylation dependent. Secreted CCL3 and CCL4 were detected as a heterodimer. Our results indicate the CpG-independent synergy between PS-ODN and GM-CSF mediated through chemokine and dendritic cell induction. In addition, our observations suggest that PS-ODN plus GM-CSF may be useful as potent ex vivo dendritic cell differentiation/maturation agents for dendritic cell therapy and as vaccine adjuvants for tumor and infectious microorganisms, including HIV-1

	15882964, ole of Rho family GTPases in CCR1- and CCR5-induced actin reorganization in macrophages.The beta-chemokines, MIP-1alpha/CCL3, MIP-1beta/CCL4, and RANTES/CCL5, play a critical role in the selective accumulation and activation of macrophages in inflamed tissues. Herein, we demonstrate that the binding of each of these beta-chemokines to their cognate receptors, CCR1 and CCR5, in either macrophages or in CCR1- or CCR5-transfected CHO cells, induced actin reorganization and the formation of lamellipodia that are characteristic of the activation of the Rho family GTPase, Rac. A dominant negative mutant of Rac, but not dominant negative mutants of RhoA or Cdc42, blocked MIP-1alpha-induced lamellipodia formation. Moreover, this MIP-1alpha-induced Rac activation and consequent lamellipodia formation is Gi- and phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)-mediated. Thus, Rac activation is critical for both CCR1- and CCR5-triggered signaling cascades mediating beta-chemokine-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, a process essential for effective recruitment and activation of macrophages in inflammation

	15954896, hemokine response to febrile urinary tract infection.BACKGROUND: Mucosal CXC chemokines recruit inflammatory cells to the infected urinary tract. The chemokine response repertoire of the urinary tract and the relationship to disease severity have not been examined, however. METHODS: This study quantified CXC (CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9, and CXCL10) and CC (CCL2, CCL4, and CCL5) chemokines in sequential urine samples obtained from 50 patients with febrile urinary tract infections during 24 hours after diagnosis. RESULTS: All patients had elevated chemokine levels, but bacteremic infections caused higher CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL8, and CCL2 responses. CCL2 and CXCL8 levels were higher in patients with acute pyelonephritis symptoms and CCL2, CXCL3, CCL4, CXCL5, and CXCL10 were significantly correlated to C-reactive protein (CRP) and temperature. Women and men showed different chemokine responses. CONCLUSION: Febrile urinary tract infections are accompanied by a complex chemokine response. The response magnitude reflects disease severity, and the repertoire is influenced by gender and underlying disease

	15982312, ype I interferons inhibit maturation and activation of mouse Langerhans cells.Type I interferons (IFN) have an essential role in antiviral defense, and they are produced upon viral infection in a variety of cells. IFN-alpha/beta treatment of immature dendritic cells (DC) is known to induce their phenotypic and functional maturation, but it remains unclear whether stimulation by this cytokine family influences the functions and maturation of Langerhans cells (LC). We used highly enriched (&gt;95%) LC directly isolated from BALB/c mouse skin and addressed this issue, comparing LC with splenic CD11c(+) DC. Type I IFN-treated LC exhibited impaired ability to produce IL-12 and inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, whereas IL-10 production was not augmented. In splenic DC, the production of inflammatory cytokines was rather enhanced by type I IFN treatment. With regard to chemokines, in both LC and splenic DC, type I IFN upregulated the production of inflammatory chemokines, such as CXCL10, CXCL11, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5. Strikingly, IFN-beta treatment reduced the expression of CD40, CD54, CD80, and CD86 on LC, whereas IFN-beta-treated splenic DC showed enhanced expression of these molecules. Furthermore, IFN-beta-treated LC had impaired costimulatory activity for anti-CD3-induced proliferation of T cells. Finally, treatment with IFN-alpha/beta reduced the migratory capacity of LC to CCL21. These results indicate that type I IFN inhibit maturation and activation of LC in a direct manner. Our observations may provide a novel explanation for the reported inability of LC to act as potent antigen-presenting cells in cutaneous and mucosal viral infection

	16015368, ariants of CCR5, which are permissive for HIV-1 infection, show distinct functional responses to CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5.CCR5 is one of the primary coreceptors for Env-mediated fusion between cells and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Analyses of CCR5 variants in cohorts of HIV-1 high-risk individuals led to the identification of multiple single amino-acid substitutions, which may have functional consequences. This study focused on eight naturally occurring allelic variants located between amino-acid residues 60 and 334 of CCR5. All studied allelic variants were highly expressed on the cell surface of HEK-293 cells and permissive for HIV-1 infection. Variant G301V showed 3.5-fold increase in 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) for CCL4 (MIP 1beta) in a competitive binding assay. There was also a significant reduction in CCL5 (RANTES) EC(50) for the R223Q, A335V and Y339F variants. The most unexpected functional abnormality was exhibited by the R60S variant that exhibited a loss of ligand-induced desensitization in chemotaxis assays, but showed normal CCL4 and CCL5 binding avidity. This mutation is located in the first intracellular loop, a domain that has not previously been shown to be involved in receptor desensitization. In conclusion, our results support earlier studies showing that these naturally occurring point mutations do not limit HIV-1 infection, and indicated that single amino-acid changes can have unexpected functional consequences

	16076464, ransgenic mouse expressing human CCR5 as a model for in vivo assessments of human selective CCR5 antagonists.The species selectivity of receptor antagonists often hinders their preclinical assessment in vivo. In order to evaluate human selective CC chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) antagonists in vivo, we generated human CCR5 transgenic mice that expressed the transgene on both peripheral blood leukocytes as well as thymocytes. The selective CCR5 ligand CC chemokine ligand 4 (CCL4)/macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1beta induced the chemotaxis of thymocytes that had been derived from the transgenic mice, but not from littermate mice, suggesting that the human CCR5 expressed in the transgenic mice were functional. The binding of the human CCR5 specific antibody 45531 to peripheral blood granulocytes from the transgenic mice was inhibited by human selective CCR5 antagonist SCH-351125. Using this antibody, we developed an ex vivo assay system that is suitable for the evaluation of a test compound's ability to occupy the human CCR5 receptor on mouse peripheral blood leukocytes. This transgenic mouse model is useful for estimating the pharmacodynamics of human selective CCR5 antagonists in vivo

	16101183, hemokines in human colorectal carcinoma.BACKGROUND: Chemokines (CKs) may promote antitumor immunity in cancer, act as tumor growth factors, influence metastatic spreading or angiogenesis. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether CK expression is altered in colorectal carcinomas compared to normal mucosa and to elucidate its possible clinico-pathological implications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The levels of CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL4 (MIP-1beta), CCL5 (RANTES), CXCL 1 (GRO-alpha), CXCL 5 (ENA-78) and CXCL 8 (IL-8) were investigated in 10 colorectal carcinomas and their corresponding normal mucosa by the use of ELISA. RESULTS: All CK analyzed, with the exception of CCL5 (RANTES), were expressed at a significantly higher level in malignant tissue. CONCLUSION: Therapeutic studies in colon carcinomas should, therefore, focus more on the neutralization of CKs than on their application

	16160188, uman immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp120 and other activation stimuli are highly effective in triggering alpha interferon and CC chemokine production in circulating plasmacytoid but not myeloid dendritic cells.Exposure to aldrithiol-2-inactivated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or gp120, but not gp41, triggered alpha interferon (IFN-alpha), CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL3, and CCL4 production in human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) but not in myeloid DCs (M-DCs) or monocyte-derived DCs from the same donors. The nonresponsiveness of M-DCs for IFN-alpha/beta production was a general feature specific to these cells, as they also failed to produce it in response to inactivated influenza virus, poly(I-C), lipopolysaccharide, Staphylococcus aureus Cowans I, or CD40L. The different capacities of circulating DC subsets to produce immune mediators in response to most stimuli argue for a different role for these cells in the regulation of innate immunity to pathogens

	16175603, CR5 deficiency exacerbates T-cell-mediated hepatitis in mice.Experimental T-cell-mediated hepatitis induced by concanavalin A (Con A) involves the production of different cytokines and chemokines and is characterized by leukocyte infiltration. Because the chemokine receptor CCR5 and its ligands (CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5) regulate leukocyte chemotaxis and activation, we investigated the role of CCR5 during Con A-induced liver injury. Serum levels of CCR5 ligands and their hepatic transcript levels were significantly increased after Con A injection, whereas CCR5+ liver mononuclear cells were recruited to the liver. CCR5-deficient (CCR5-/-) mice disclosed increased mortality and liver injury following Con A administration compared with wild-type mice. CCR5-/- mice also exhibited increased production of interleukin 4, tumor necrosis factor alpha, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5, and a prominent liver mononuclear cell infiltrate, among which many cells were CCR1+. In vivo neutralization of CCR5 ligands in CCR5-/- mice afforded a protection against hepatitis only when CCL5 was neutralized. In conclusion, CCR5 deficiency exacerbates T-cell-mediated hepatitis, and leads to increased levels of CCR5 ligands and a more pronounced liver mononuclear infiltrate, suggesting that CCR5 expression can modulate severity of immuno-mediated liver injury

	16178877, dentification of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced genes in human mast cells using suppression subtractive hybridization: up-regulation of IL-8 and CCL4 production.Mast cells have recently been found to be a major player in the host defence against bacterial infection through secretion of potent mediators. Identification of bacteria-induced mast cell mediators and intracellular signalling molecules involved during bacterial infection remains a major area of investigation. Recently we found an active interaction between mast cells and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria. To further characterize specific genes in mast cells modulated by P. aeruginosa, we used a new approach for the study of mast cell-bacteria interaction; the suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH). SSH approach does not require a prerequisite knowledge of target genes and does not rely on the availability of the assay reagents for the specific genes. Using SSH, 94 clones were randomly selected from the subtracted cDNA library for differential screening leading to the identification of 14 P. aeruginosa-up-regulated transcripts. Sequence analysis revealed that expression of IL-1, IL-8 and CCL4 was increased by human mast cells after P. aeruginosa infection. Increased production of IL-1, IL-8 and CCL4 was confirmed at the protein levels. In addition, sequence analysis of the clones also suggests that ribosomal protein S3 and cytochrome b as well as additional 4 uncharacterized genes may potentially be involved in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis. Thus, SSH is an effective approach by identifying potential molecular targets for the study of mechanisms involved in P. aeruginosa and mast cell interaction

	16205356, lcohol suppresses IL-2-induced CC chemokine production by natural killer cells.BACKGROUND: Natural killer (NK) cells are a critical component of the host innate immune system. We investigated whether alcohol impairs NK cell function, particularly production of CC chemokines induced by interleukin (IL)-2, the natural ligands for CCR5 receptor. METHODS: Primary NK cells and NK cell line (YTS) were cultured with or without alcohol (10 to 80 mM) for three hours. The culture supernatants were then harvested and used to treat human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages and a HeLa cell line, which expresses CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4 receptors (MAGI cells). CC chemokine expression by YTS and primary NK cells treated with or without alcohol was analyzed with the real-time RT-PCR and ELISA. [Ca(2)(+)]i and Western blot assays were used to determine calcium-mediated intracellular signaling pathway and NF-kappaB p65 expression. HIV strains (Bal and UG024) were used to infect macrophages and MAGI cells. In addition, ADA (macrophage-tropic strain) and murine leukemia virus (MLV) envelope-pseudotyped HIV infection was carried out in macrophages. HIV infectivity was determined by HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) and beta-galactosidase activity assays. RESULTS: Alcohol inhibited IL-2-induced CC chemokine (CCL3 and CCL4) expression by NK cells. Functional tests demonstrated that this reduced expression of CC chemokines was associated with diminished anti-HIV ability of NK cells. Alcohol also reduced the ability of NK cells to response to CCL3-mediated chemotaxis. Alcohol inhibited IL-2-induced NF-kappaB p65 protein expression and calcium mobilization by NK cells. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol, through the inhibition of IL-2-induced NF-kappaB p65 protein expression and intracellular calcium mobilization, suppressed NK cell production of CC chemokines. This suppression of CC chemokine production was associated with diminished anti-HIV activity of NK cells. Thus, by inhibiting NK cell-mediated innate immunity against HIV, alcohol consumption may have a cofactor role in the immunopathogenesis of HIV disease

	16287062, antle cell lymphomas acquire increased expression of CCL4, CCL5 and 4-1BB-L implicated in cell survival.We have analyzed mantle cell lymphomas (MCLs), using high-density DNA microarrays, and confirmed the expression of differentially regulated antigens, using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. The results show that MCLs acquire expression of molecules that normally are involved in interaction with other immune cells and, thus, might affect the ability of the tumor to survive. The MCL signature is represented by the overexpression of the chemokine CCL4 (MIP-1beta), implicated in the recruitment of regulatory T cells, as well as CCL5 and 4-1BB-L. The latter molecules are normally involved in chemotaxis of T cells and B cell activation, respectively. Signaling through 4-1BB-L allows B cells to proliferate and the expression of its ligand, by the intra-tumoral mesh of follicular dendritic cells (FDC), could thus serve as a paracrine loop facilitating growth and survival of MCL cells

	16433713, ltered chemokine levels in individuals at risk of Type 1 diabetes mellitus.AIMS: The hypothesis was tested in an exploratory study that individuals at high risk of developing Type 1 diabetes mellitus have altered systemic levels of cytokines and chemokines. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forty-two non-diabetic first-degree relatives of patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus were recruited. Of these, 18 had multiple islet autoantibodies (islet cell antibody, glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody, IA-2 antibody). Follow-up for 9-11 years confirmed high vs. moderate diabetes risk in islet autoantibody-positive vs. -negative relatives. Cytokines and chemokines were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Serum concentrations of classic Th1-associated cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-12, IL-18) or Th2/Treg-associated cytokines (IL-5, IL-10, IL-13) did not significantly differ in high vs. moderate diabetes risk group. However, of six chemokines analysed, levels of CCL3 and CCL4 were increased (P = 0.0442 and P = 0.0334) while CCL2 was decreased (P = 0.0318) in the multiple islet autoantibody-positive group. No significant differences were seen for CCL5, CCL11, CXCL10. There was a significant correlation between the two closely related chemokines CCL3 and CCL4 in individuals at risk (r = 0.84, P = 0.00005), but not in the autoantibody-negative group. CONCLUSION: Relatives at high risk of developing Type 1 diabetes mellitus have abnormal cellular immune regulation at the level of systemic chemokines. The up-regulation of CCL3 and CCL4 vs. down-regulation of CCL2 suggests opposed functions of these chemokines in the disease process. These findings need to be confirmed by independent studies

	16452465, he chemokines, CX3CL1, CCL14, and CCL4, promote human trophoblast migration at the feto-maternal interface.Human embryo implantation is a complex process involving blastocyst attachment to the endometrial epithelium and subsequent trophoblast invasion of the decidua. Chemokines, critical regulators of leukocyte migration, are abundant in endometrial epithelial and decidual cells at this time. We hypothesized that endometrial chemokines stimulate trophoblast invasion. Chemokine receptors CX3CR1 and CCR1 were immunolocalized in human first-trimester implantation sites, specifically to endovascular extravillous trophoblasts, but not to the invading interstitial EVTs (iEVTs), with weak staining also on syncytium. CCR3 was localized to invading iEVTs and to microvilli on the syncytial surface. Expression of CX3CL1 (fractalkine), CCL7 (MCP-3), and their receptors (CX3CR1, CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, and CCR5) mRNA was examined in cellular components of the maternal-embryonic interface by RT-PCR. Both chemokines were abundant in entire endometrium and placenta, endometrial cells (primary cultures and HES, a human endometrial epithelial cell line) and trophoblast cell lines (JEG-3, ACIM-88, and ACIM-32). Chemokine receptor mRNA was expressed by placenta and trophoblast cell lines: CCR1 by all trophoblast cell types, whereas CCR2, CCR3, and CX3CR1 were more variable. CX3CR1, CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5 were also expressed by endometrial cells. Migration assays used the trophoblast cell line most closely resembling extravillous cytotrophoblast (AC1M-88). Trophoblast migration occurred in response to CX3CL1, CCL14, and CCL4, but not CCL7. Endometrial cell-conditioned media also stimulated trophoblast migration; this was attenuated by neutralizing antibodies to CX3CL1 and CCL4. Thus, chemokines are expressed by maternal and embryonic cells during implantation, whereas corresponding receptors are on trophoblast cells. Promotion of trophoblast migration by chemokines and endometrial cell conditioned medium indicates an important involvement of chemokines in maternal-fetal communication

	16612374, hemokines enhance immunity by guiding naive CD8+ T cells to sites of CD4+ T cell-dendritic cell interaction.CD8+ T cells have a crucial role in resistance to pathogens and can kill malignant cells; however, some critical functions of these lymphocytes depend on helper activity provided by a distinct population of CD4+ T cells. Cooperation between these lymphocyte subsets involves recognition of antigens co-presented by the same dendritic cell, but the frequencies of such antigen-bearing cells early in an infection and of the relevant naive T cells are both low. This suggests that an active mechanism facilitates the necessary cell-cell associations. Here we demonstrate that after immunization but before antigen recognition, naive CD8+ T cells in immunogen-draining lymph nodes upregulate the chemokine receptor CCR5, permitting these cells to be attracted to sites of antigen-specific dendritic cell-CD4+ T cell interaction where the cognate chemokines CCL3 and CCL4 (also known as MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta) are produced. Interference with this actively guided recruitment markedly reduces the ability of CD4+ T cells to promote memory CD8+ T-cell generation, indicating that an orchestrated series of differentiation events drives nonrandom cell-cell interactions within lymph nodes, optimizing CD8+ T-cell immune responses involving the few antigen-specific precursors present in the naive repertoire

	16637021, ltered thymocyte migration during experimental acute Trypanosoma cruzi infection: combined role of fibronectin and the chemokines CXCL12 and CCL4.We previously showed migration disturbances in the thymus during experimental infection with Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. These changes were related to the enhanced expression of extracellular matrix ligands and receptors, leading to the escape of immature cells to the periphery. Here, we analyzed the expression and role of selected chemokines (CXCL12 and CCL4) and their receptors (CXCR4 and CCR5) in regulating thymocyte migration in conjunction with extracellular matrix during acute T. cruzi infection. We found increased chemokine deposition in the thymus of infected mice when compared to controls, accompanied by enhanced co-localization with fibronectin as well as up-regulated surface expression of CXCR4 and CCR5 in thymocytes. We also noticed altered thymocyte migration towards the chemokines analyzed. Such an enhancement was even more prominent when fibronectin was added as a haptotatic stimulus in combination with a given chemokine. Our findings suggest that thymocyte migration results from a combined action of chemokines and extracellular matrix (ECM), which can be altered during pathological conditions such as T. cruzi infection, and may be at the origin of the changes in the T cell repertoire seen in this pathological process

	16699301, ne-tube-PCR technique for CCL2, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 applied to fine needle aspiration biopsies shows different profiles in autoimmune and non-autoimmune thyroid disorders.Autoimmune thyroid diseases are characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid gland. Chemokines are crucial in the recruitment of lymphocytes and might play an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid disease. The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of analysing by one-tube reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique CC chemokine profiles in samples obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). In 27 out of 35 (77%) samples, the material was sufficient for analysis and in 16 (59%) chemokines were detected, thus demonstrating the potential of this technique. Moreover, even in this small group, a statistically significant increase of CCL3 and CCL4 was found in samples from patients with autoimmune thyroid disease as compared to those with multinodular goiter. Chemokine profile measured by improved multiamplification techniques in FNAB thyroid samples may become a useful complementary tool for the management of thyroid autoimmune disease as it constitutes a source of data for research of their pathogenesis

	16760409, educed ability of newborns to produce CCL3 is associated with increased susceptibility to perinatal human immunodeficiency virus 1 transmission.The role of CC chemokines in protection against mother-to-child human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission is not well understood. It was observed that mitogen-induced production of CCL3 and CCL4 by cord-blood mononuclear cells was increased among infants born to HIV-positive compared with HIV-negative mothers, and that a deficiency in production of CCL3 was associated with increased susceptibility to intrapartum HIV-1 infection. CCL3-L1 gene copy number was associated with CCL3 production and with vertical transmission. However, at equivalent CCL3-L1 gene copy numbers, infants who acquired HIV-1 infection relative to their exposed but uninfected counterparts had lower production of CCL3, suggesting that they may harbour some non-functional copies of this gene. Nucleotide changes that may influence CCL3 production were evident in the CCL3 and CCL3-L1 genes upstream of exon 2. Our findings suggest that infants who display a deficient-production phenotype of CCL3 are at increased risk of acquiring HIV-1, indicating that this chemokine in particular plays an essential role in protective immunity

	16773571, enetic variation in the CCL18-CCL3-CCL4 chemokine gene cluster influences HIV Type 1 transmission and AIDS disease progression.CCL3 (MIP-1 alpha), CCL4 (MIP-1 beta), and CCL18 (DC-CK1/PARC/AMAC-1) are potent chemoattractants produced by macrophages, natural killer cells, fibroblasts, mast cells, CD4(+) T cells, and CD8(+) T cells. CCL3 and CCL4 are natural ligands for the primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coreceptor CCR5 and are also known to activate and enhance the cytotoxicity of natural killer cells. Genomic DNAs from &gt;3,000 participants enrolled in five United States-based natural-history cohorts with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were genotyped for 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a 47-kb interval on chromosome 17q12 containing the genes CCL3, CCL4, and CCL18. All 21 SNPs were polymorphic in African Americans (AAs), whereas 7 of the 21 had minor-allele frequencies &lt;0.01 in European Americans (EAs). Substantial linkage disequilibrium was observed in a 37-kb interval containing 17 SNPs where many pairwise D' values exceeded 0.70 in both racial groups, but particularly in EAs. Four and three haplotype blocks were observed in AAs and EAs, respectively. Blocks were strongly correlated with each other, and common haplotype diversity within blocks was limited. Two significant associations are reported that replicate an earlier study. First, among AA members of the AIDS Link to the Intravenous Experience cohort of injection drug users, frequencies of three correlated SNPs covering 2,231 bp in CCL3 were significantly elevated among highly exposed, persistently HIV-1-uninfected individuals compared with HIV-1-infected seroconvertors (P = .02-.03). Second, seven highly correlated SNPs spanning 36 kb and containing all three genes were significantly associated with more-rapid disease progression among EAs enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study cohort (P = .01-.02). These results reiterate the importance of chemokine gene variation in HIV-1/AIDS pathogenesis and emphasize that localized linkage disequilibrium makes the identification of causal mutations difficult

	16815159,  network-based analysis of the late-phase reaction of the skin.BACKGROUND: The late-phase reaction (LPR) of the skin is an in vivo model of allergic inflammation. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify disease-associated pathways in the LPR using a network-based analysis. METHODS: The LPR was examined by means of DNA microarray analysis of skin biopsy specimens from 10 patients with allergic rhinitis and 10 healthy control subjects. The results were further analyzed in 2 different materials consisting of nasal fluids and allergen-challenged CD4(+) T cells from patients with allergic rhinitis. RESULTS: The DNA microarray analysis revealed several genes of known relevance to allergy. The eosinophil marker Charcot-Leyden crystal protein (CLC) that encodes Charcot-Leyden crystal protein differed most in expression. A network-based analysis showed upregulation of IL-4- and CCL4-dependent pathways and downregulation of a TGF-beta-induced pathway. CCL4 is expressed by CD4(+) T cells and chemotactic for eosinophils. We hypothesized that allergen induces release of CCL4 from T(H)2 cells and that this contributes to influx of eosinophils. Further analysis showed increase of CCL4 protein in nasal fluids from allergic patients during the season. Allergen challenge of PBMCs resulted in proliferation of T(H)2 cells and increased production of CCL4 in CD4(+) T cells from allergic patients. An analysis of the DNA microarray data revealed a significant correlation between CCL4 and the eosinophil marker CLC. CONCLUSION: A network-based analysis of the LPR showed increased activity of IL-4- and CCL4- dependent pathways and downregulation of the TGF-beta-induced pathway. Allergen-induced release of CCL4 from T(H)2 cells might contribute to influx of eosinophils during the LPR. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Involvement of multiple interacting pathways indicates that it might be difficult to identify one single mediator as a biomarker or drug target in allergic inflammation

	16979363,  DNA vaccine encoding CCL4/MIP-1beta enhances myocarditis in experimental Trypanosoma cruzi infection in rats.Chagas' disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is a major cause of cardiovascular disease in Latin America. Exacerbated inflammation disproportional to parasite load characterizes chronic myocardial lesions in chagasic patients. Chemokines and their receptors are expected to account for the renewed inflammatory processes after the inoculation of the parasite, but their potential unique functions are far from being clear. Herein, we evaluated the effect of a DNA vaccine encoding CCL4/MIP-1beta, a CC-chemokine, in T. cruzi-elicited myocarditis in rats. Holtzman rats were given intramuscularly cardiotoxin and the CCL4/MIP-1beta DNA-containing plasmid (100microg) was delivered in this muscular site four times. Fourteen days after last immunization, animals were inoculated with a myotropical CL-Brener T. cruzi clone. Peak of parasitism was observed at day 15 after infection, preceding the peak of myocardial inflammation at day 20. Myocarditis was still intense at day 30, but the inflammatory infiltrates showed a more focal distribution. The expression of CCL2/MCP-1 and CCL4/MIP-1beta correlated closely with the kinetics of myocardial inflammation. The CCL4/MIP-1beta DNA vaccine induced an increase of the levels of the anti-CCL4/MIP-1beta observed in T. cruzi-infected animals. This was associated with an exacerbation of myocardial inflammation and fibrosis, although alterations in parasitemia and myocardial parasitism were not observed. Our data suggest that CCL4/MIP-1beta plays a role in preventing excessive inflammation and pathology rather than in controlling parasite replication

	16982098, ctivating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) represses the expression of CCL4 in murine macrophages.Acute expression of macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (also known as CCL4) promotes beneficial leukocyte recruitment to infected tissues, but chronic expression of this chemokine contributes to inflammatory disease. CCL4 expression is controlled largely at the transcriptional level and an ATF/CRE sequence located in the promoter (-104 to -97bp, relative to the transcriptional start site) has been identified as a critical cis-acting element. The trans-acting binding proteins that influence CCL4 transcription via this site are largely unknown. We investigated whether activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a member of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors, binds to the CCL4 ATF/CRE site in macrophages. Using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay and the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we found that ATF3 binds to the ATF/CRE site within the CCL4 promoter in untreated and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that CCL4 mRNA levels in elicited peritoneal macrophages from ATF3(-/-) mice are significantly higher than in congenic ATF3(+/+) macrophages under both unstimulated and LPS-stimulated conditions, suggesting that ATF3 represses transcription of the CCL4 gene. Consistent with the higher gene expression, ATF3-deficient macrophages secreted more CCL4 protein than ATF3(+/+) macrophages. Similar results were obtained in bone-marrow-derived macrophages treated with Toll-like receptor 2, 3, 4 and 5 agonists. Thus, we conclude that ATF3 constitutively binds to the ATF/CRE site in the CCL4 promoter where it represses basal and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-stimulated transcription. Consequently, ATF3 appears to be part of a control mechanism that limits the amount of CCL4 released by macrophages, preventing excessive inflammation

	16988274, ytokine and chemokine transcription profile during Mycoplasma pulmonis infection in susceptible and resistant strains of mice: macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta (CCL4) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 2 (CCL8) and accumulation of CCR5+ Th cells.The progression of murine mycoplasma pneumonia is dependent on T cells and other immune cells. The role of cytokines in immunity are complex, and identifying the network of cytokines produced after infection of mice is essential in dissecting the key cytokine cascades involved mycoplasma disease pathogenesis. In the present study, mRNA expression of 143 different cytokines, chemokines, or receptors were evaluated in lung tissues from both susceptible (BALB/c and C3H/HeN) and resistant (C57BL/6) mice after Mycoplasma pulmonis infection. To accomplish this, membrane-based cDNA microarrays were used to monitor changes mRNA expression in lungs. There was a clear association with disease susceptibility and development of cytokine mRNA expression. In addition to proinflammatory cytokines, mRNA expression of an anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10, increased with disease severity, suggesting an attempt to moderate the severity of the inflammatory response. Furthermore, it is clear that an array of chemokines produced in susceptible mice could contribute to the recruitment and maintenance of inflammatory cells at the site of disease. In support of this, there was an increase in macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta (MIP-1beta; CCL4) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 2 (MCP-2; CCL8) mRNA levels from mycoplasma-infected mice and a corresponding accumulation of CD4+ Th cells expressing the MIP-1beta/MCP-2 receptor, CCR5, in the lungs of mice. Furthermore, MIP-1beta- and MCP-2-producing cells and CD4+ T cells were found to be in close association in pulmonary lesions. Thus, there was a significant cytokine response associated with disease pathogenesis, and these studies provide important leads and insights into ongoing cytokine- and chemokine-mediated processes in this persistent inflammatory disease

	17143825, nfluence of human T cell lymphotropic virus type 2 coinfection on virological and immunological parameters in HIV type 1-infected patients.BACKGROUND: Human T cell lymphotropic virus type 2 (HTLV-2) infection is not rare among injection drug users with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and may exert a protective role in the progression of HIV disease. METHODS: Immunological and virological parameters were compared in HIV-HTLV-2-coinfected patients and a control group of HIV-monoinfected subjects. All individuals were antiretroviral therapy naive. HIV-specific CD8+ T cell levels were measured using an interferon-gamma assay in response to 125 optimally defined HIV peptides divided into 5 pools. Immune activation was evaluated by measuring levels of CD38 in different CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. In a subgroup of patients, the production of CCL4 in parallel with interferon-gamma was assessed in response to Gag peptides. RESULTS: Lower plasma HIV-RNA levels were found in HIV-HTLV-2-coinfected patients than in HIV-monoinfected patients, despite the 2 groups having similar CD4+ T cell counts. Coinfected patients also had significantly lower levels of CD38 expression in total CD8+ T cells and in its naive subset. CD8+ T cell levels specific for each pool of peptides were similar in both groups, but cells mainly contributing to HIV Gag-specific responses in coinfected patients were CCL4 positive and interferon-gamma negative, whereas for HIV-monoinfected subjects, the response was dominated by CCL4-positive and interferon-gamma-positive cells. CONCLUSIONS: HTLV-2 coinfection may exert a protective role on HIV disease progression by lowering HIV replication and immune activation. A predominance of CCL4 single positive HIV-specific CD8+ T cells in HIV-HTLV-2-coinfected patients could explain this effect

	17178789, nduction of host chemotactic response by Encephalitozoon spp.Microsporidians are a group of emerging pathogens typically associated with chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised individuals. The number of reports of infections with these organisms and the disseminated pathology is growing as diagnostic tools become more readily available. However, little is known about the innate immune response induced by and generated against these parasites. Using a coculture chemotaxis system, primary human macrophages were infected with Encephalitozoon cuniculi or Encephalitozoon intestinalis, and the recruitment of naïve monocytes was monitored. Encephalitozoon spp. induced an average threefold increase in migration of naïve cells 48 h postinfection, which corresponded to optimal infection of monocyte-derived-macrophages. A limited microarray analysis of infected macrophages revealed several chemokines involved in the inflammatory responses whose expression was upregulated, including CCL1, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL7, CCL15, CCL20, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5, and CXCL8. The levels of 6 of 11 chemokines also present in the microarray were confirmed to be elevated by protein profiling. Kinetic studies confirmed that secreted CCL2, CCL3, and CCL4 were expressed as early as 6 h postinfection, with peak expression at 12 to 24 h and expression remaining until 48 h postinfection. Neutralization of these chemokines, specifically CCL4, significantly reduced the number of migrating cells in vitro, indicating their role in the induction of monocyte migration. This mechanism of recruitment not only supports the evidence that in vivo cellular infiltration occurs but also provides new hosts for the parasites, which escape macrophages by rupturing the host cell. To our knowledge, this is the first documentation that chemokine production is induced by microsporidian infections in human macrophages

	17178797, xpression of immunomodulatory genes in human monocytes induced by voriconazole in the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus.We assessed the effect of voriconazole (VRC) on the expression and release of selected cytokines and chemokines in the THP-1 human monocytic cell line in response to Aspergillus fumigatus hyphal fragments (HF) by cDNA microarray analysis, reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Stimulation of THP-1 cells by HF alone caused a significant up-regulation of CCL4 (MIP1B) and CCL16, while CCL2 (MCP1) was down-regulated. By comparison, in the presence of VRC, a large number of genes such as CCL3 (MIP1A), CCL4 (MIP1B), CCL5 (RANTES), CCL7 (MCP3), CCL11 (EOTAXIN), CCL15 (MIP1Delta), CXCL6, and CXCL13 were strongly up-regulated in THP-1 cells challenged by HF, whereas CCL20 (MIP3A) and CCL21 (MIP2) were down-regulated. Among five genes differentially expressed in THP-1 cells, IL12A, IL12B, and IL-16 were down-regulated whereas IL-11 and TGFB1 were significantly up-regulated in the presence of VRC. The inflammation-related genes IFNgamma, IL1R1, and TNFA were also up-regulated in THP-1 cells exposed to HF only in the presence of VRC. RT-PCR of four selected genes validated the results of microarrays. The release of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-12 was significantly increased from monocytes stimulated either by HF alone (P &lt; 0.05) or in the presence of VRC (P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.05, respectively). In contrast, tumor necrosis factor alpha release from monocytes was enhanced only in the presence of VRC (P &lt; 0.01). The chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta were decreased under both conditions (P &lt; 0.01). These results demonstrate that in the presence of VRC, HF induces a more pronounced profile of gene expression in THP-1 cells than HF alone, potentially leading to more-efficient host resistance to A. fumigatus

	17195767, hemokine responses are increased in HIV-infected Malawian children with invasive pneumococcal disease.BACKGROUND: Chemokines play an important role in the recruitment and regulation of leukocyte traffic during bacterial infection. The aims of this study were to investigate the chemokine response to invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and to examine the influence of HIV infection on the chemokine response, pneumococcal bacterial loads, and outcome. METHODS: We prospectively studied 95 children with IPD, and blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were taken at admission for the determination of chemokines, interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), and pneumococcal bacterial loads. RESULTS: Plasma CXCL8 and CCL2, CSF CXCL8 and CCL4, and IFNgamma were significantly higher in HIV-infected children than in HIV-uninfected children. Blood and CSF pneumococcal bacterial loads correlated with plasma and CSF chemokines, respectively, and were higher in HIV-infected children compared with HIV-uninfected children. Among HIV-infected children, plasma concentrations of CXCL8 and CCL2 were significantly higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors, but CCL5 was significantly lower. HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children with IPD had higher concentrations of chemokines (except CCL5) than acutely ill HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children with no detectable bacterial infection. Male gender and low plasma CCL2 concentrations were shown to be independently associated with survival. CONCLUSIONS: Chemokines, in particular CCL2, are associated with survival in IPD and correlate with pneumococcal bacterial loads, disease presentation, and outcome

	17327452, e>CCL4 protects from type 1 diabetes by altering islet beta-cell-targeted inflammatory responses.We previously reported that interleukin (IL)-4 treatment of nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice elevates intrapancreatic CCL4 expression and protects from type 1 diabetes. Here, we show that antibody neutralization of CCL4 abrogates the ability of T-cells from IL-4-treated NOD mice to transfer protection against type 1 diabetes. Intradermal delivery of CCL4 via a plasmid vector stabilized by incorporation of the Epstein-Barr virus EBNA1/oriP episomal maintenance replicon (pHERO8100-CCL4) to NOD mice beginning at later stages of disease progression protects against type 1 diabetes. This protection was associated with a Th2-like response in the spleen and pancreas; decreased recruitment of activated CD8(+) T-cells to islets, accompanied by diminished CCR5 expression on CD8(+) T-cells; and regulatory T-cell activity in the draining pancreatic lymph nodes. Thus, inflammatory responses that target islet beta-cells are suppressed by CCL4, which implicates the use of CCL4 therapeutically to prevent type 1 diabetes

	17330138, CL3L1 and CCL4L1: variable gene copy number in adolescents with and without human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.As members of the chemokine family, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1alpha) and MIP-1beta are unique in that they both consist of non-allelic isoforms encoded by different genes, namely chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (CCL3), CCL4, CCL3-like 1 (CCL3L1) and CCL4L1. The products of these genes and of CCL5 (encoding RANTES, i.e., regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted) can block or interfere with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection through competitive binding to chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5). Our analyses of 411 adolescents confirmed that CCL3 and CCL4 genes occurred invariably as single copies (two per diploid genome), whereas the copy numbers of CCL3L1 and CCL4L1 varied extensively (0-11 and 1-6 copies, respectively). Neither CCL3L1 nor CCL4L1 gene copy number variation showed appreciable impact on susceptibility to or control of HIV-1 infection. Within individuals, linear correlation between CCL3L1 and CCL4L1 copy numbers was moderate regardless of ethnicity (Pearson correlation coefficients=0.63-0.65, P&lt;0.0001), suggesting that the two loci are not always within the same segmental duplication unit. Persistently low serum MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta (in the pg/ml range) compared with high CCL5 concentration (ng/ml range) implied that multi-copy genes CCL3L1 and CCL4L1 conferred little advantage in the intensity of expression among uninfected or infected adolescents

	17475893, he CCL3 family of chemokines and innate immunity cooperate in vivo in the eradication of an established lymphoma xenograft by rituximab.The therapeutic mAb rituximab induced the expression of the CCL3 and CCL4 chemokines in the human lymphoma line BJAB following binding to the CD20 Ag. Induction of CCL3/4 in vitro was specific, was observed in several cell lines and freshly isolated lymphoma samples and also took place at the protein level in vitro and in vivo. To investigate the role of these beta-chemokines in the mechanism of action of rituximab, we synthesized a N-terminally truncated CCL3 molecule CCL3(11-70), which had antagonist activity on chemotaxis mediated by either CCL3 or BJAB supernatant. We also set up an established s.c. BJAB tumor model in athymic mice. Rituximab, given weekly after tumors had reached 250 mm2, led to complete disappearance of the lymphoma within 2-3 wk. Treatment of mice with cobra venom factor showed that complement was required for rituximab therapeutic activity. Treatment of BJAB tumor bearing mice every 2 days with the CCL3(11-70) antagonist, starting 1 wk before rituximab treatment, had no effect on tumor growth by itself, but completely inhibited the therapeutic activity of the Ab. To determine whether CCL3 acts through recruitment/activation of immune cells, we specifically depleted NK cells, polymorphonuclear cells, and macrophages using mAbs, clodronate treatment, or Rag2-/-cgamma-/- mice. The data demonstrated that these different cell populations are involved in BJAB tumor eradication. We propose that rituximab rapidly activates complement and induces beta-chemokines in vivo, which in turn activate the innate immunity network required for efficient eradication of the bulky BJAB tumor

	17483450, dentification of a human CD8+ regulatory T cell subset that mediates suppression through the chemokine CC chemokine ligand 4.Regulatory T cells (Treg) comprise multiple subsets and are important in controlling immunity and inflammation. However, the induction and mode of action of the various distinct Treg subsets remain ill defined, particularly in humans. Here, we describe a human CD8+ lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3)+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg subset, which suppresses T cells partly through the secretion of CC chemokine ligand 4 (CCL4), which can inhibit T cell activation by interfering with T cell receptor signaling. CD8+ Tregs are expanded by antigen in in vivo-primed donors, and can be detected in pathogen-infected human tissue. This CD8+LAG-3+CD25+FoxP3+CCL4+ Treg subset thus may play a role in immunoregulation in humans, including infectious diseases

	17640866, olecular cloning and characterization of a highly selective chemokine-binding protein from the tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus.Ticks are blood-feeding parasites that secrete a number of immuno-modulatory factors to evade the host immune response. Saliva isolated from different species of ticks has recently been shown to contain chemokine neutralizing activity. To characterize this activity, we constructed a cDNA library from the salivary glands of the common brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus. Pools of cDNA clones from the library were transfected into HEK293 cells, and the conditioned media from the transfected cells were tested for chemokine binding activity by chemical cross-linking to radiolabeled CCL3 followed by SDS-PAGE. By de-convolution of a single positive pool of 270 clones, we identified a full-length cDNA encoding a protein of 114 amino acids, which after signal peptide cleavage was predicted to yield a mature protein of 94 amino acids that we called Evasin-1. Recombinant Evasin-1 was produced in HEK293 cells and in insect cells. Using surface plasmon resonance we were able to show that Evasin-1 was exquisitely selective for 3 CC chemokines, CCL3 and CCL4 and the closely related chemokine CCL18, with K(D) values of 0.16, 0.81, and 3.21 nm, respectively. The affinities for CCL3 and CCL4 were confirmed in competition receptor binding assays. Analysis by size exclusion chromatography demonstrated that Evasin-1 was monomeric and formed a 1:1 complex with CCL3. Thus, unlike the other chemokine-binding proteins identified to date from viruses and from the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni, Evasin-1 is highly specific for a subgroup of CC chemokines, which may reflect a specific role for these chemokines in host defense against parasites

	17684570,  decline in CCL3-5 chemokine gene expression during primary simian-human immunodeficiency virus infection.BACKGROUND: The CC-chemokines CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 have been found to block the entry of CCR5-tropic HIV into host cells and to suppress the viral replication in vitro, but the in vivo role of endogenous CC-chemokines in HIV-1 infection is still incompletely understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: In this study, the primate host CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 gene expression was evaluated in response to simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection in rhesus macaque model. Five rhesus macaques were inoculated with CCR5-tropic SHIV(SF162P4). The mRNA levels of CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 were measured by real-time PCR at post inoculation day (PID) 0, 7, 14, 21, 35, 56 and 180 in peripheral blood. In addition, a selected subset of samples from CXCR4-tropic SHIV(Ku1)-infected macaques was included with objective to compare the differences in CC-chemokine down-regulation caused by the two SHIVs. Gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) collected from SHIV(SF162P4)-infected animals were also tested by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy to corroborate the gene expression results. Predictably, higher viral loads and CD4+ T cell losses were observed at PID 14 in macaques infected with SHIV(Ku1) than with SHIV(SF162P4). A decline in CC-chemokine gene expression was also found during primary (PID 7-21), but not chronic (PID 180) stage of infection. CONCLUSIONS: It was determined that A) SHIV(SF162P4) down-regulated the CC-chemokine gene expression during acute stage of infection to a greater extent (p&lt;0.05) than SHIV(Ku1), and B) such down-regulation was not paralleled with the CD4+ T cell depletion. Evaluation of CC-chemokine enhancing immunomodulators such as synthetic CpG-oligonucleotides could be explored in future HIV vaccine studies

	17716649, ecretion of antiretroviral chemokines by human cells cultured with acyclic nucleoside phosphonates.Acyclic nucleoside phosphonates are novel class of clinically broadly used antivirotics effective against replication of both DNA viruses and retroviruses including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We have investigated their in vitro effects on immune defence mechanisms in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, with the main emphasis on expression of cytokines which are able to suppress the entry of HIV in cells. Included in the study were prototype acyclic nucleoside phosphonates, i.e. 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]adenine (PMEA; adefovir), 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]-2,6-diaminopurine (PMEDAP), (R)-and (S)-enantiomers of 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine [(R)-PMPA; tenofovir] and [(S)-PMPA], and of 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]-2,6-diaminopurine [(R)-PMPDAP] and [(S)-PMPDAP], and their N(6)-substituted derivatives. Some of the compounds were found to substantially enhance secretion of chemokines such as macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-alpha/CCL3), and  regulated on activation of normal T cell expressed and secreted  (RANTES/CCL5). Secretion of MIP-1beta/CCL4 was only marginally increased, whereas production of interleukin-16 (IL-16) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) remained uninfluenced. The most effective proved to be the N(6)-cyclooctyl-PMEDAP, N(6)-isobutyl-PMEDAP, N(6)-pyrrolidino-PMEDAP, N(6)-cyclopropyl-(R)-PMPDAP, and N(6)-cyclopentyl-(R)-PMPDAP derivatives. Remarkably enhanced secretion of chemokines was reached within 2-4 h of the cell culture, and was observed at concentration of 2-5 microM. It may be suggested that acyclic nucleoside phosphonates represent a new generation of antivirotics with combined antimetabolic and therapeutically prospective immunostimulatory properties

	17765942, ntigen stimulation induces HIV envelope gp120-specific CD4(+) T cells to secrete CCR5 ligands and suppress HIV infection.CD4(+) T cells are critical for effective immune responses against HIV, but they are also the main cell type targeted by the virus. To investigate the key factors that could protect these cells from infection, we evaluated the capacity of HIV gp120-specific human CD4(+) T cells to produce chemokines that inhibit HIV and determined their contribution in suppressing infection in the cells. Antigen stimulation of the CD4(+) T cells elicited production of high amounts of CCR5 chemokines MIP-1alpha (CCL3), MIP-1beta (CCL4), and RANTES (CCL5). Production of these CCR5 ligands was more readily and reproducibly detected than that of IFN-gamma or IL-2. Importantly, in association with secretion of the CCR5 ligands, antigen stimulation made these CD4(+) T cells more resistant to CCR5-tropic HIV-1. Conversely, in the absence of antigen stimulation, the cells were readily infected by the virus, and after infection, their capacity to produce MIP-1beta and IFN-gamma rapidly declined. Thus, vaccines that trigger HIV-specific CD4(+) T cells to elicit robust and rapid production of anti-viral chemokines would be advantageous. Such responses would protect virus-specific CD4(+) T cells from HIV infection and preserve their critical functions in mounting and maintaining long-lasting immunity against the virus

	17848804, ffect of ciclesonide treatment on allergen-induced changes in T cell regulation in asthma.BACKGROUND: The allergen-induced release of CCL17/thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) may be crucial in asthmatic airway inflammation by recruitment of Th2 cells. In addition, it might lead to aberrant Th2 cell activity through impairment of beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR) control. We questioned how chemokine patterns change upon allergen challenge and whether treatment with the inhaled steroid ciclesonide can reduce chemokine release and subsequently prevent allergen-induced changes in Th2 cell regulation and migration. METHODS: Asthma patients were double-blindly treated with placebo or 80 microg ciclesonide for 7 days. We studied allergen-induced changes in sputum chemokines, migration of peripheral blood T cells and control of beta2-agonist fenoterol over T cell migration and alpha-CD3/alpha-CD28-induced cytokine production. RESULTS: Treatment with 80 microg ciclesonide significantly diminished the late asthmatic response. The late asthmatic response was associated with increased sputum levels of CCL17 and CCL4 (but none of the other chemokines measured) and loss of beta2-AR control over T cell migration and Th2-type cytokine production. Although ciclesonide treatment did not prevent chemokine release nor altered beta2-AR function in circulating T cells, it exerted an inhibitory effect on TARC-induced T cell migration and alpha-CD3/alpha-CD28-induced cytokine production. CONCLUSION: Our data support the hypothesis that CCL17 is involved in allergen-induced dysregulation of Th2 cell migration and cytokine production. Ciclesonide treatment inhibits T cell migration and cytokine production upon allergen inhalation, which is regulated independently from reducing CCL17 release, but may contribute to beneficial effects of ciclesonide on Th2-mediated airway inflammation

	17920466, ene expression profile of macrophage-like U937 cells in response to polyethylene particles: a novel cell-particle culture system.We investigated the gene expression profiles of U937 cells after contact with polyethylene particles. U937 cells were differentiated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and cocultured with either retrieved polyethylene particles or commercially produced polyethylene particles (Ceridust 3615, Clariant Japan, Tokyo, Japan). To achieve consistent contact with the polyethylene particles, we used a rotating device. Phagocytosis of the polyethylene particles or retrieved polyethylene particles by differentiated U937 cells stimulated the release of cytokines including interleukin 1beta, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, and vascular endothelial growth factor. Microarray analysis revealed that the expression of IL8, CCL4, CXCR4, and some other genes was up-regulated after contact with retrieved polyethylene particles. This study first reports the gene expression profiles of U937 cells after contact with polyethylene particles. We believe that this experimental model is applicable to all other particulate materials

	18005268, yeloma cell expression of 10 candidate genes for osteolytic bone disease. Only overexpression of DKK1 correlates with clinical bone involvement at diagnosis.Osteolytic bone disease (OBD) in multiple myeloma (MM) is caused by interactions between MM cells and the bone marrow microenvironment and is characterized by increased osteoclastic bone resorption and decreased osteoblastic bone formation. Recently, the role of osteoblast inhibition has come into focus, especially the possible role of overexpression of DKK1, an inhibitor of the Wnt signalling pathway. Further, CKS2, PSME2 and DHFR have also been reported as candidate genes for OBD. We studied the gene expression by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of TNFSF11 (RANKL), TNFSF11A (RANK), TNFRSF11B (OPG), CCL3 (MIP1A), CCL4 (MIP1B), PTHR1 (PTHrp), DKK1, CKS2, PSME2 and DHFR in purified, immunophenotypic FACS-sorted plasma cells from 171 newly diagnosed MM patients, 20 patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and 12 controls. The gene expressions of the analysed genes were correlated with radiographically assessed OBD. Only overexpression of DKK1 was correlated to the degree of OBD. Myeloma cells did not express TNFSF11A, TNFSF11, or TNFRSF11B, and very rarely expressed CCL3 and PTHR11. CCL4, CKS2, PSME2 and DHFR were variably expressed, but the expression of these genes showed no correlation with OBD. In contrast, loss of PSME2 expression in MM plasma cells was significantly correlated with OBD

	18048089, he urokinase-type plasminogen activator/its soluble receptor system is independently related to carotid atherosclerosis and associated with CC-chemokines in uraemic patients.INTRODUCTION: The urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)/its soluble receptor (suPAR) and CC-chemokines are two systems contributing in the atherosclerosis. We try to establish whether these two systems were associated among themselves, and the significance of this potential association in relation to carotid atherosclerosis in uraemic patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We determined uPA, suPAR, CC-chemokines: monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2), macrophage inflammatory proteins (CCL3, CCL4), regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (CCL5) and the intima-media thickness (IMT) values in uraemic patients on peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), haemodialysis (HD) and healthy controls. RESULTS: The values of the uPA/suPAR system, CCL2, CCL4 and IMT in the patients significantly exceeded those in controls, whereas CCL5 were lower in the patients than in the controls. CCL3 concentrations were similar in all investigated groups. CCL2, CCL4 and CCL5 were positively associated with uPA/suPAR system. CCL2 and CCL4 were associated with IMT. Multivariate analysis showed that uPA, suPAR and age were the strong independent variables linked to IMT values. CONCLUSIONS: The carotid atherosclerosis is independently related to uPA/its soluble receptor system in dialysis patients. In addition, the strong positive associations existed between uPA/suPAR system and CC-chemokines suggesting that these two systems could cooperate and influence of atherosclerosis in these patients

	18056395, aspase-4 interacts with TNF receptor-associated factor 6 and mediates lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-kappaB-dependent production of IL-8 and CC chemokine ligand 4 (macrophage-inflammatory protein-1 ).Human caspase-4 does not have a corresponding mouse ortholog. Caspase-4 falls within the class of  inflammatory caspases,  being homologous with human caspases 1 and 5 and mouse caspases 1, 11, and 12. To address the function of caspase-4, we generated caspase-4-deficient human THP1 monocytic cell lines which exhibited substantially reduced LPS-induced secretion of several chemokines and cytokines, including IL-8 (CXCL8), CCL4 (macrophage-inflammatory protein-1beta), CCL20 (macrophage-inflammatory protein-3alpha), and IL-1beta. The LPS-induced expression of the mRNAs encoding these cytokines was correspondingly reduced in the caspase-4-deficient clones. Because a specific NF-kappaB inhibitor blocked LPS-induced IL-8 and CCL4 mRNA expression as well as IL-8 and CCL4 secretion in THP1 cells, we investigated the role of caspase-4 in NF-kappaB signaling. LPS-induced NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and activation were inhibited in all caspase-4-deficient clones. LPS stimulation led to the interaction of endogenous caspase-4 and TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) via a TRAF6-binding motif (PPESGE), which we identified in caspase-4. Mutation of this site in caspase-4 resulted in the loss of the TRAF6-caspase-4 interaction. Similar TRAF6-binding motifs are known to be functionally important for TRAF6 interactions with other molecules including caspase-8, and for mediating NF-kappaB activation in various immune and nonimmune cell types. Our data suggest that the TRAF6-caspase-4 interaction, triggered by LPS, leads to NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional up-regulation and secretion of important cytokines and chemokines in innate immune signaling in human monocytic cells

	18076643, ossible role of the innate immunity in temporal lobe epilepsy.PURPOSE: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a multifactorial disease often involving the hippocampus. So far the etiology of the disease has remained elusive. In some pharmacoresistant TLE patients the hippocampus is surgically resected as treatment. To investigate the involvement of the immune system in human TLE, we performed large-scale gene expression profiling on this human hippocampal tissue. METHODS: Microarray analysis was performed on hippocampal specimen from TLE patients with and without hippocampal sclerosis and from autopsy controls (n = 4 per group). We used a common reference pool design to perform an unbiased three-way comparison between the two patient groups and the autopsy controls. Differentially expressed genes were statistically analyzed for significant overrepresentation of gene ontology (GO) classes. RESULTS: Three-way analysis identified 618 differentially expressed genes. GO analysis identified immunity and defense genes as most affected in TLE. Particularly, the chemokines CCL3 and CCL4 were highly (&gt;10-fold) upregulated. Other highly affected gene classes include neuropeptides, chaperonins (protein protection), and the ubiquitin/proteasome system (protein degradation). DISCUSSION: The strong upregulation of CCL3 and CCL4 implicates these chemokines in the etiology and pathogenesis of TLE. These chemokines, which are mainly expressed by glia, may directly or indirectly affect neuronal excitability. Genes and gene clusters identified here may provide targets for developing new TLE therapies and candidates for genetic research

	18178567, ighly potent HIV inhibition: engineering a key anti-HIV structure from PSC-RANTES into MIP-1 beta/CCL4.The HIV coreceptor CCR5 is a validated target for both the prevention and therapy of HIV infection. PSC-RANTES, an N-terminally modified analogue of one of the natural chemokine ligands of CCR5 (RANTES/CCL5), is a potent inhibitor of HIV entry into target cells. Here, we set out to engineer the anti-HIV activity of PSC-RANTES into another natural CCR5 ligand (MIP-1beta/CCL4), by grafting into it the key N-terminal pharmacophore region from PSC-RANTES. We were able to identify MIP-1beta/CCL4 analogues that retain the receptor binding profile of MIP-1beta/CCL4, but acquire the very high anti-HIV potency and characteristic inhibitory mechanism of PSC-RANTES. Unexpectedly, we discovered that in addition to N-terminal structures from PSC-RANTES, the side chain of Lys33 is also necessary for full anti-HIV potency

	18203956, hosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C activation is required for CCR5-dependent, NF-kB-driven CCL2 secretion elicited in response to HIV-1 gp120 in human primary macrophages.CCL2 (MCP-1) has been shown to enhance HIV-1 replication. The expression of this chemokine by macrophages is up-modulated as a consequence of viral infection or gp120 exposure. In this study, we show for the first time that the phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) is required for the production of CCL2 triggered by gp120 in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Using a combination of pharmacologic inhibition, confocal laser-scanner microscopy, and enzymatic activity assay, we demonstrate that R5 gp120 interaction with CCR5 activates PC-PLC, as assessed by a time-dependent modification of its subcellular distribution and a concentration-dependent increase of its enzymatic activity. Furthermore, PC-PLC is required for NF-kB-mediated CCL2 production triggered by R5 gp120. Notably, PC-PLC activation through CCR5 is specifically induced by gp120, since triggering CCR5 through its natural ligand CCL4 (MIP-1beta) does not affect PC-PLC cellular distribution and enzymatic activity, as well as CCL2 secretion, thus suggesting that different signaling pathways can be activated through CCR5 interaction with HIV-1 or chemokine ligands. The identification of PC-PLC as a critical mediator of well-defined gp120-mediated effects in MDMs unravels a novel mechanism involved in bystander activation and may contribute to define potential therapeutic targets to block Env-triggered pathologic responses

	18223665, ffect of CCR5 receptor antagonists on endocytosis of the human CCR5 receptor in CHO-K1 cells.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The CCR5 chemokine receptor is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family that is expressed by macrophages, memory T-lymphocytes and dendritic cells and is activated by chemotactic proteins (e.g. MIP-1alpha [CCL3], MIP-1beta [CCL4] and RANTES [CCL5]). CCR5 is also the principal co-receptor for macrophage-tropic strains of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and some chemokines can inhibit HIV-1 infection by stimulating CCR5 receptor endocytosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of CCR5 antagonists on CCR5 endocytosis. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The effects of CCR5 agonists and antagonists on receptor internalization in CHO cells, expressing a C-terminal green fluorescent protein-tagged human CCR5 receptor (CCR5-GFP), were quantified using a confocal imaging plate reader. KEY RESULTS: MIP-1alpha [CCL3], MIP-1beta [CCL4] and RANTES [CCL5] were all able to stimulate potently the internalization of CCR5-GFP. This effect was inhibited by the non-peptide antagonist TAK 779. The CCR5 peptide antagonist met-RANTES antagonized MIP-1alpha-mediated increases in intracellular free calcium but was also able to stimulate a substantial internalization of the human CCR5-GFP receptor. However, CHO cells exhibited an aminopeptidase activity that was able to metabolize sufficient met-RANTES into an agonist metabolite capable of stimulating calcium mobilization via CCR5 receptors in naïve cells. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These data suggest that there is an endogenous aminopeptidase activity on the surface of CHO cells, that produces a slow internalization of the receptor following a time-dependent conversion of receptor-bound met-RANTES from a CCR5 receptor antagonist into a CCR5 agonist molecule

	18236400, ole of the cytokine environment and cytokine receptor expression on the generation of functionally distinct dendritic cells from human monocytes.Myeloid dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages evolve from a common precursor. However, factors controlling monocyte differentiation toward DC or macrophages are poorly defined. We report that the surface density of the GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSFR) alpha subunit in human peripheral blood monocytes varies among donors. Although no correlation was found between the extent of GM-CSFR and monocyte differentiation into DC driven by GM-CSF and IL-4, GM-CSFR expression strongly influenced the generation of CD1a(+) dendritic-like cells in the absence of IL-4. CD1a(+) cells generated in the presence of GM-CSF express CD40, CD80, MHC class I and II, DC-SIGN, MR, CCR5, and partially retain CD14 expression. Interestingly, they spontaneously induce the expansion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) allogeneic T lymphocytes producing IFN-gamma, and migrate toward CCL4 and CCL19. Upon stimulation with TLR ligands, they acquire the phenotypic features of mature DC. In contrast, the allostimulatory capacity is not further increased upon LPS activation. However, by blocking LPS-induced IL-10, a higher T cell proliferative response and IL-12 production were observed. Interestingly, IL-23 secretion was not affected by endogenous IL-10. These results highlight the importance of GM-CSFR expression in monocytes for cytokine-induced DC generation and point to GM-CSF as a direct player in the generation of functionally distinct DC

	18368065, opulation structure in copy number variation and SNPs in the CCL4L chemokine gene.The recent description of a large amount of copy number variation (CNV) in the human genome has extended the concept of genome diversity. In this study we integrate the analysis of CNV and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human CCL4L chemokine gene. CCL4L is a nonallelic copy of CCL4/MIP-1beta chemokine and displays a CNV that also includes the CCL3L gene, a nonallelic copy of CCL3/MIP-1alpha. This CNV and two functionally relevant CCL4L SNPs (rs4796195 and rs3744595) have been recently associated to HIV pathology in three independent studies. We have quantified the CCL4L copy number and genotyped both SNPs in samples from HGDP-CEPH Diversity Panel. A strong correlation between CCL4L CNV and one of the SNPs analyzed is found, whereas no significant linkage disequilibrium is found between the two SNPs despite their close distance (647 bp), suggesting a recent appearance of the second SNP when the diversity in the first one and CNV had already been generated. The present study points out that in genes with CNV, it may be a key issue to combine the assessment of gene copy number with the genotyping of relevant SNPs to understand the phenotypic impact of genome variation in the immune response

	18434252, elation of circulating concentrations of chemokine receptor CCR5 ligands to C-peptide, proinsulin and HbA1c and disease progression in type 1 diabetes.Th1 related chemokines CCL3 and CCL5 and Th2 related CCL4 as ligands of the receptor CCR5 contribute to disease development in animal models of type 1 diabetes. In humans, no data are available addressing the role of these chemokines regarding disease progression and remission. We investigated longitudinally circulating concentrations of CCR5 ligands of 256 newly diagnosed patients with type 1 diabetes. CCR5 ligands were differentially associated with beta-cell function and clinical remission. CCL5 was decreased in remitters and positively associated with HbA1c suggestive of a Th1 associated progression of the disease. Likewise, CCL3 was negatively related to C-peptide and positively associated with the beta-cell stress marker proinsulin but increased in remitters. CCL4 associated with decreased beta-cell stress shown by negative association with proinsulin. Blockage of chemokines or antagonism of CCR5 by therapeutic agents such as maraviroc may provide a new therapeutic target to ameliorate disease progression in type 1 diabetes

	18440239, ender differences in inflammatory proteins and pathways in seasonal allergic rhinitis.In model organisms, thousands of genes differ in expression between females and males. It is not known if differences on a similar scale are found in humans nor how this relates to disease. However, in allergic disease gender differences in the levels of both inflammatory cells and proteins have been shown. In this study, we found lower nasal fluid allergen-specific IgE in women than men with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). This led to genome-wide analyses of gene expression in allergen-challenged CD4(+) cells from patients with SAR before and after treatment with cortisone. Before treatment, 975 genes differed in expression between women and men: 337 were higher in women. After treatment only 428 genes and one pathway differed in expression. The genes that differed in expression between women and men were over-represented in 10 pathways. Five of the pathways regulated chemotaxis. All five were less active in women. One of the pathways was induced by the eosinophilic chemokine CCL4. Analysis of nasal fluid CCL4 protein confirmed lower levels in women with seasonal allergic rhinitis, before and during the pollen season. By contrast, nasal fluid CCL3 levels did not differ between the genders. In summary, this study shows gender differences in specific inflammatory pathways and proteins in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Further studies are warranted to examine if such differences have diagnostic and therapeutic implications in allergic diseases

	18447713, hemokine detection in the cerebral tissue of patients with posttraumatic brain contusions.OBJECT: The clinical outcome of patients with severe head injuries is still critically dependent on their secondary injuries. Although hypoxia and hypotension appear to mediate a substantial proportion of secondary injuries, many studies associate secondary brain injury with neuroinflammatory responses. Chemokines have been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid but not in the brain tissue of patients with head trauma. This study was performed to determine if chemokines were expressed in pericontusional brain tissue in patients with moderate or severe head trauma who underwent surgical evacuation of their brain contusions. METHODS: Twelve patients with posttraumatic cerebral contusion requiring a surgical evacuation were studied. A 20- to 40-mg sample of white matter was removed from the surgical cavity in the pericontusional area. Two patients undergoing elective surgery for clip ligation of an unruptured aneurysm were used as controls. The median interval from trauma to biopsy procedure was 44 hours (range 3-360 hours). Total RNA was isolated from these samples and a ribonuclease protection assay was performed to measure the mRNA levels of several chemokines: CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL10, and XCL1. RESULTS: The CCL2, a monocyte chemoattractant produced by activated astrocytes, was the most strongly expressed chemokine, followed by CXCL8, CCL3, and CCL4. The chemokines CXCL10 and CCL5 were expressed at very low levels, and XCL1 was not detected. CONCLUSIONS: Chemokine activation occurs early after moderate or severe head trauma and is maintained for several days after trauma. This event may contribute to neuroinflammatory exacerbation of posttraumatic brain damage in the pericontusional brain tissue

	18534709, hree-day tetrahydrobiopterin therapy increases in vivo hepatic NOS activity and reduces portal pressure in CCl4 cirrhotic rats.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Tetrahydrobiopterin is an essential cofactor for NOS enzymes to synthesize NO. It has been suggested that reduced intrahepatic tetrahydrobiopterin decreases intrahepatic NO and contributes to increase hepatic vascular resistance and portal pressure in cirrhosis. The main aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of tetrahydrobiopterin supplementation in portal pressure in CCl4 cirrhotic rats. METHODS: Cirrhotic rats received vehicle or tetrahydrobiopterin (10mg/kg/day i.p.) for 3 days. Hepatic and systemic hemodynamics and hepatic tetrahydrobiopterin, NOS activity and cGMP levels were measured. In addition, hepatic and systemic hemodynamics were evaluated in normal rats in which tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency was induced by administrating 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxy-pyrimidine (DAHP) for 8h. RESULTS: In cirrhotic rats, tetrahydrobiopterin administration increased liver NOS activity and cGMP levels and markedly and significantly reduced portal pressure. Amelioration of portal hypertension was associated with a normalization of arterial pressure. In normal rats DAHP decreased hepatic tetrahydrobiopterin and NOS activity and increased hepatic vascular tone. These effects of DAHP administration were corrected by tetrahydrobiopterin supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that tetrahydrobiopterin markedly reduces portal hypertension and improves systemic hemodynamics in cirrhotic rats. These data support the concept that tetrahydrobiopterin supplementation may represent a new therapeutic strategy for portal hypertension

	18547752, p-regulation of hepatic heme oxygenase-1 expression by locally induced interleukin-6 in rats administered carbon tetrachloride intraperitoneally.We previously reported that interleukin-6 (IL-6) was locally produced in the early period after intraperitoneal (i.p.) or subcutaneous carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) administration, but not after oral (p.o.) administration. In the present study, we focused on the up-regulation of stress-inducible proteins induced by IL-6 after i.p. CCl4 administration. The expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) (EC 1.14.99.3) mRNA and protein were induced more in rats administered CCl4 via the i.p. route, compared with the p.o. route; however, expression of heat shock protein (HSP) 72 and HSP90 mRNA were increased to similar extents in both experimental groups. The induction of HO-1 mRNA and protein after i.p. CCl4 administration were significantly reduced after pretreatment with anti-rat IL-6 antibody. Activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 3 (STAT3), which promotes HO-1 expression, peaked together with plasma levels of IL-6 after i.p. CCl4 administration, suggesting that hepatic HO-1 expression was increased by IL-6 via the Janus kinase/STAT3 pathway. The present data indicate that hepatic HO-1 is up-regulated by endogenously produced IL-6, in addition to its up-regulation by heme derived from cytochrome P450 which has already been reported in rats administered i.p. CCl4. The up-regulation of hepatic HO-1 expression may reduce the tissue injury to livers caused by CCl4

	18583118, ffect of pretreatment with artichoke extract on carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury and oxidative stress.Artichoke is a plant with antioxidant properties. In this study, we investigated the effect of artichoke extract pretreatment on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity. Rats were given artichoke leaf extract (1.5g/kg/day) by gavage for 2 weeks and after then CCl4 (1ml/kg; i.p.) was applied. All rats were killed 24h after the CCl4 injection. CCl4 administration resulted in hepatic necrosis and significant increases in plasma transaminase activities as well as hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) and diene conjugate (DC) levels in the liver of rats. Glutathione (GSH) and vitamin C levels decreased, but vitamin E levels increased in the liver of CCl4-treated rats. Hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities remained unchanged, but glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and glutathione transferase (GST) activities decreased following CCl4 treatment. In rats pretreated with artichoke extract, significant decreases in plasma transaminase activities and amelioration in histopathological changes in the liver were observed following CCl4 treatment as compared to CCl4-treated rats. In addition, hepatic MDA and DC levels decreased, but GSH levels and GSH-Px activities increased without any change in other antioxidant parameters following CCl4 treatment in artichoke-pretreated rats. The present findings indicate that in vivo architoke extract administration may be useful for the prevention of oxidative stress-induced hepatotoxicity

	18593218, sing artificial burrows to evaluate inhalation risks to burrowing mammals.Since the onset of plutonium production at the U.S. Department of Energy's Hanford Site, several hundred cubic meters of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) has been discharged to the soil column, resulting in a dispersed CCI4 vapor plume in the subsurface. Inhalation of volatile organic chemicals could be an important exposure pathway for burrowing animals there. Historical levels of CCl4 in soil pore gas exceeded the inhalation ecological screening level for CCl4. Thus, the inhalation exposure pathway was evaluated with the use of artificial burrows deployed at locations that had elevated levels of CCl4 in soil gas. Artificial burrows were designed on the basis of information available for Hanford Site fossorial wildlife. After installation, the artificial burrow atmosphere was sampled and analyzed for CCl4 and its degradation products: chloroform, methylene chloride, and chloromethane. Sampling was repeated on 3 occasions to capture varying atmospheric conditions affecting exposure concentrations. CCl4 was detected in the artificial burrows, and maximum exposures were observed during relatively low barometric conditions. The highest CCl4 detections were still well below the inhalation-based ecological screening level and CCl4 degradation products were never detected. This study shows that artificial burrows are an efficient method for obtaining relevant exposure data and illustrates the utility of directly measuring the medium for exposure under ecologically realistic conditions

	18598162, urcumin or saikosaponin a improves hepatic antioxidant capacity and protects against CCl4-induced liver injury in rats.Curcumin and saikosaponin a, the bioactive phytochemicals of turmeric and Bupleurum, act as antioxidants. This study investigated the effects of supplementation with curcumin and/or saikosaponin a on hepatic lipids and antioxidant status in rats with CCl(4)-induced liver injury. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control, CCl(4), CCl(4) + curcumin (0.005%; CU), CCl(4) + saikosaponin a (0.004%; SS), and CCl(4) + curcumin + saikosaponin a (0.005% + 0.004%; CU+SS) groups. CCl(4) (40% in olive oil) was injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 0.75 mL/kg once a week. Curcumin and/or saikosaponin a was administered orally 1 week before CCl(4) injection for 8 weeks. The pathological results showed that liver fibrosis was ameliorated in the SS and CU+SS groups. After 8 weeks, supplementation with curcumin and/or saikosaponin a significantly decreased plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities, as well as plasma and hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The CU+SS group showed reversal of the impaired hepatic superoxide dismutase activity and an increase in total glutathione level. Supplementation with curcumin and/or saikosaponin a significantly improved hepatic antioxidant status and suppressed malondialdehyde formation. Therefore, supplementation with curcumin and/or saikosaponin a protects against CCl(4)-induced liver injury by attenuating hepatic lipids and lipid peroxidation and enhancing antioxidant defense. Curcumin and saikosaponin a had no additive effects on hepatoprotection except for greater improvement in the total glutathione level and antioxidant status

	18598176, aengshik, a formulated health food, prevents liver damage in CCl4-induced mice and increases antioxidant activity in elderly women.Saengshik is a Korean noncooked food made with of more than 30 different whole gains, vegetables, fruits, mushrooms, and seaweeds. All of these ingredients are frozen and dried to minimize the loss of nutrients. Saengshik has become popular among health-conscious people in the Republic of Korea. The study aims to investigate antioxidant effects of Saengshik by in vivo and human experiments. In in vivo tests, mice were fed Saengshik for 4 weeks, and oxidative damage was induced by CCl(4). Then the effects of Saengshik on oxidative damage were examined. It was found that plasma lipid hydroperoxide and protein oxidative damages were significantly suppressed and antioxidants, glutathione, and thiol groups were increased. The activity of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase was increased, and the level of glutamate pyruvate transaminase was decreased. In a human study, elderly people were given Saengshik for 24 weeks, and changes in antioxidant defense of the body were examined. Antioxidant activities in plasma were enhanced, although the difference was not significant. Therefore, it is expected that Saengshik is effective at removing oxidants from body tissues, preventing oxidative damage, and eventually boosting the antioxidant capacity of the body

	18602778,  study on antioxidant, free radical scavenging, anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective actions of Aegiceras corniculatum (stem) extracts.AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was conducted to evaluate the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective potential of Aegiceras corniculatum Linn. Blanco (Aegicerataceae). METHODS AND RESULTS: The n-hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts, derived from Aegiceras corniculatum stems, scavenged superoxide anions (O2*) and hydroxyl radicals (*OH) in nitro blue tetrazolium reduction and deoxyribose degradation assays, respectively. All the extracts inhibited the process of lipid peroxidation at its initiation step. Additionally, in rat liver microsomes n-hexane and ethyl acetate extracts also caused termination of radical chain reaction supporting their scavenging action towards lipid peroxy radicals (LOO*). Moreover, increased production of O2* in human neutrophils, stimulated by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and/or opsonized zymosan were also suppressed (IC50 approximately 3-20 microg/mL). Thereby, revealing the ability of plant extracts to antagonize the oxidative stress via interference with NADPH oxidase metabolic pathway. These in vitro results coincide with the reduction in the glucose oxidase-induced paw edema in mice in the presence of ethyl acetate and methanol extracts (10, 50, and 100mg/kg, i.p.). Plant extracts (250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg, p.o.) also significantly protected the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced oxidative tissue injury in rat liver. This was reflected by a approximately 60% decline in the levels of serum aminotransferase enzymes. CONCLUSION: Aegiceras corniculatum extracts found to possess pronounced antioxidant effect that may be at least in part related to its anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective activities. This study provides a scientific basis for the ethnomedical claims that Aegiceras corniculatum is effective against inflammation and liver injury

	18602877,  metabonomic characterization of CCl4-induced acute liver failure using partial least square regression based on the GC/MS metabolic profiles of plasma in mice.This work characterized the metabolism disorders of acute liver failure (ALF) induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) in a mouse model with different dosage of intoxication (100, 500 and 1000 mg/kg). Metabolic profiles of mice plasma were detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) after chemical derivatization. Here an effective information-extracting approach was implemented on the basis of partial least square regression analysis (PLS-RA). PLS modeling was achieved with two kinds of Y-vectors for the acquired metabonomics data and eight metabolites with different changing behaviors were selected. ALF of mice induced by CCl(4) was characterized by the elevation of glutamate, citrate, serine and threonine, as well as the decrease of alpha-glycerophosphate, docosahexaenoic acid, palmitic acid and oleic acid in plasma. The difference in the concentrations of serine, threonine, palmitic acid and oleic acid remained insignificant between the control and 100mg/kg groups, while significant distinction appeared when comparing the control and two higher dosed groups. The underlying regulation of CCl(4)-perturbed metabolic pathways was discussed according to the selected metabolites. The present study demonstrated a great potential of PLS-RA in exploiting a comprehensive metabolic effects of CCl(4) intoxication and its efficient capability to reveal the hepatotoxic mechanism of ALF induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS)

	18622472, ole of N-acetylcysteine on fibrosis and oxidative stress in cirrhotic rats.BACKGROUND: Hepatic cirrhosis is the final stage of liver dysfunction, characterized by diffuse fibrosis which is the main response to the liver injury. The inhalatory carbon tetrachloride is an effective experimental model that triggers cirrhosis and allows to obtain histological and physiological modifications similar to the one seen in humans. AIM: To investigate the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on the fibrosis and oxidative stress in the liver of cirrhotic rats, analyzing liver function tests, lipoperoxidation, activity of glutathione peroxidase enzyme, collagen quantification, histopathology, as well as the nitric oxide role. METHODS: The animals were randomly in three experimental groups: control (CO); cirrhotic (CCl4) and CCl4 + NAC. Evaluate the lipid peroxidation, the glutathione peroxidase enzyme, the collagen and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). RESULTS: The cirrhotic group treated with N-acetylcysteine showed trough the histological analysis and collagen quantification lower degrees of fibrosis. This group has also shown less damage to the cellular membranes, less decrease on the glutathione peroxidase levels and less expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase when matched with the cirrhotic group without treatment. CONCLUSION: N-acetylcysteine seams to offer protection against hepatic fibrosis and oxidative stress in cirrhotic rat livers

	18626430, lack bean extract ameliorates liver fibrosis in rats with CCl4-induced injury.We assessed the anti-fibrotic effects of methanolic black bean extract antioxidants in a carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) liver injury model in rats. Experimentally intoxicated animals received CCl4 for eight weeks, the reference and test groups received daily intragastric quercetin or daily intragastric black bean extract. Liver fibrosis was assessed and quantified using morphometric analysis. Expression of fibrosis related genes was measured by real time RT-PCR. Qualitative and quantitative histological analysis showed that administration of 70 mg/kg b.w. of black bean extract reduced hepatic fibrosis index by 18% compared to positive controls (P 0.006), as a result of a decrease in type I (44.3% less, P 0.03) and type IV (68.9% less, P 0.049) collagen gene expression compared to CCl4-injured and Quercetin treated rats. In conclusion, we provide evidence that this methanol black bean extract ameliorates liver fibrosis and types I and IV collagen gene expression, in the animal model used. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The compounds contained in this black bean extract exhibited strong antifibrotic effects in the CCl4 chronic liver injury model used; considering that this compounds are contained in a leguminous that has been used in human diet for a long time, their toxic potential should be very low, and this characteristic should favor their potential use in some other chronic or degenerative states that include an increase in inflammation and oxidative burst in their pathogenesis. Another possible application of this kind of extract could be its use as an antimicrobial or even antiparasitic therapeutic agent, although it is purely speculative

	18664124, Morphometry of hepatocyte mitochondrial apparatus in normal and cirrhotic rat liver]Morphometric electron microscopy study of the hepatocyte mitochondrial apparatus and morphofunctional analysis of the degree of pathological alterations were carried out on the liver of rats with CCL4-cirrhosis (experimental group). Chronic poisoning of rats with CCL4 for 6 months led to a 4.2-fold increase in proportion of connective tissue and to a decrease in the number of hepatocytes in the liver by 21.8 %. Dry mass and ploidy of hepatocytes in the cirrhotis liver rose as compared with norm by 20.6 and 9.3%, respectively. Activities of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases in blood of rats of experimental group exceeded normal ones 2.0 and 1.4 times, respectively. Concentration of total bilirubin in blood of the cirrhotic animals increased 1.7 times, while concentration of total protein decreased by 22%. Concentration of diene conjugates in the liver of rats of experimental group increased 2.1 times as compared with normal one, while the level of malonic dialdehyde - by 34%. Activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase in the cirrhotic liver were lower than in the normal liver were lower than in the normal liver by 16 and 23 %, respectively. Morphometry of the hepatocyte mitochondrial apparatus has shown that in spite of an increase in the voluminous density of mitochondria in hepatocytes of the cirrhotic liver (by 28 %), concentration of internal mitochondrial membranes in the cells was reduced almost 1.5 times, while the total length of internal membrane in a single mitochondrion was reduced about twice as compared with norm. Thus, despite compensation of the partial loss of hepatocytes because of their polyploidization and hypertrophy, the specific synthetic activity of cells in the case of cirrhosis is decreased due to deterioration of the antioxidant system and electron transport chain of the mitochondrial apparatus

	18705752, urcumin prevents and reverses cirrhosis induced by bile duct obstruction or CCl4 in rats: role of TGF-beta modulation and oxidative stress.Curcumin is a phytophenolic compound, which is highly efficacious for treating several inflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of curcumin in preventing or reversing liver cirrhosis. A 4-week bile duct ligation (BDL) rat model was used to test the ability of curcumin (100 mg/kg, p.o., daily) to prevent cirrhosis. To reverse cirrhosis, CCl(4) was administered chronically for 3 months, and then it was withdrawn and curcumin administered for 2 months. Alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, liver histopathology, bilirubin, glycogen, reduced and oxidized glutathione, and TGF-beta (mRNA and protein) levels were assessed. Curcumin preserved normal values of markers of liver damage in BDL rats. Fibrosis, assessed by measuring hydroxyproline levels and histopathology, increased nearly fivefold after BDL and this effect was partially but significantly prevented by curcumin. BDL increased transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) levels (mRNA and proteins), while curcumin partially suppressed this mediator of fibrosis. Curcumin also partially reversed the fibrosis induced by CCl(4). Curcumin was effective in preventing and reversing cirrhosis, probably by its ability of reducing TGF-beta expression. These data suggest that curcumin might be an effective antifibrotic and fibrolitic drug in the treatment of chronic hepatic diseases

	18724385, he antioxidant activity of chondroitin-4-sulphate, in carbon tetrachloride-induced acute hepatitis in mice, involves NF-kappaB and caspase activation.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Reactive oxygen species (ROC) are the main causes of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced acute liver injury. Chondroitin-4-sulphate (C4S) is known to inhibit lipid peroxidation through antioxidant mechanisms. Activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and caspases may strongly intensify inflammation and cell damage, in addition to that directly exerted by ROS. We investigated whether treatment with C4S, besides exerting antioxidant activity, was able to modulate NF-kappaB and apoptosis activation in CCl4-induced liver injury in mice. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Acute hepatitis was induced in mice by an i.p. injection of CCl(4). Varying doses of C4S were administered i.p. 1 h before, 6 and 12 h after CCl4 injection. 24 h after CCl4 injection, the mice were killed for biochemical and histological analysis. KEY RESULTS: CCl4 injection produced: marked elevation of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase; hepatic membrane lipid peroxidation, assayed by 8-isoprostane levels; and depletion of reduced glutathione and superoxide dismutase. CCl4 also decreased NF-kappaB translocation and IkBalpha, and increased gene expression of mRNA and protein of metalloproteases (MMP)-2 and -9, and of pro- and cleaved forms of caspases-3 and -7. There was also increased liver polymorphonuclear infiltration, evaluated by elastase assay, and hepatic cell disruption.C4S treatment inhibited lipid peroxidation; blocked NF-kappaB activation and IkBalpha protein loss; decreased mRNA and proteins for MMPs and caspases; restored endogenous antioxidants; limited hepatic polymorphonuclear accumulation and tissue damage. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: As antioxidants may inhibit NF-kappaB and caspase activation, we hypothesize that treatment with C4S was able to inhibit NF-kappaB and apoptosis activation in hepatic injury

	18756597, ltrastructural changes in hepatocytes after taurine treatment in CCl4 induced liver injury.AIM: To search the organelle based changes in hepatocytes after taurine treatment in experimental liver fibrosis induced by CCl(4) administration. METHODS: Thirty rats were divided into two groups. Group 1 (n = 15) was injected with CCl(4) plus taurine and Group 2 (n = 15) with CCl(4) plus saline for 12 wk. At the end of 12th wk, mitochondria, rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclei of hepatocytes were evaluated using a scoring system. The results were compared with histopathological findings, as well. RESULTS: Taurine treatment reduced fibrosis scores significantly as compared to placebo. Organelle injury scores decreased significantly with taurine treatment. Ultrastructural and histopathological scores in both groups were in strong correlation (r = 0.931 for CCl(4) plus taurine and r = 0.899 for CCl(4) plus saline group). CONCLUSION: Organelle based transmission electron microscopy findings can reflect successfully histological results as well as tissue healing in hepatocytes from hepatotoxin-induced liver fibrosis

	18767021, ammadeltaT cell-mediated regulation of chemokine producing macrophages during Listeria monocytogenes infection-induced inflammation.Infection of gammadeltaT cell-deficient (TcRdelta-/-) mice with the intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) results in an exacerbated inflammatory response characterized by the accumulation of activated macrophages and necrotic liver lesions. Here we investigated whether changes in chemokine production by Lm-elicited macrophages contribute to this abnormal inflammatory response. In response to Lm infection, activated macrophages accumulate in the primary sites of infection in TcRdelta-/- mice and express high amounts of mRNA encoding the chemokines CCL3 (MIP-1alpha), CCL4 (MIP-1beta), CXCL2 (MIP-2) and CXCL10 (IP-10). In the infected tissues of TcRdelta-/- the number of chemokine-synthesizing macrophages was higher than in wild-type (WT) mice, with the amount of MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta secreted by individual macrophages in the spleen of TcRdelta-/- mice also being significantly higher than in WT mice. By contrast, protease activity and NO production in individual splenic macrophages of Lm-infected TcRdelta-/- and WT mice were comparable. Pathogen-elicited macrophages in TcRdelta-/- mice also expressed high levels of the CCL3 and CCL4 receptor, CCR5. In macrophage-gammadeltaT cell co-cultures, chemokine-producing macrophages were killed by cytotoxic Vgamma1+ T cells in a Fas-FasL-dependent manner consistent with the high levels of chemokine-producing macrophages seen in infected TcRdelta-/- mice being due to the absence of Vgamma1+ T cells. Together these findings highlight the importance of gammadeltaT cells in regulating macrophage anti-microbial responses

	18781776, onservation of unfavorable sequence motifs that contribute to the chemokine quaternary state.In the chemokine family, we characterize two examples of evolutionarily conserved unfavorable sequence motifs that affect quaternary structure. In contrast to the straightforward action of favorable sequences, these unfavorable motifs produce interactions disfavoring one outcome to indirectly promote another one but should not be confused with the broad sampling produced by negative selection and/or design. To identify such motifs, we developed a statistically validated computational method combining structure and phylogeny. This approach was applied in an analysis of the alternate forms of homodimerization exhibited in the chemokine family. While the chemokine family exhibits the same tertiary fold, members of certain subfamilies, including CXCL8, form a homodimer across the beta1 strand whereas members of other subfamilies, including CCL4 and CCL2, form a homodimer on the opposite side of the chemokine fold. These alternate dimerization states suggest that CCL4 and CCL2 contain specific sequences that disfavor CXCL8 dimerization. Using our computational approach, we identified two evolutionarily conserved sequence motifs in the CC subfamilies: a drastic two-residue deletion (DeltaRV) and a simple point mutation (V27R). Cloned into the CXCL8 background, these two motifs were experimentally proven to confer a monomeric state. NMR analyses indicate that these variants are structured in solution and retain the chemokine fold. Structurally, the motifs retain a chemokine tertiary fold while introducing unfavorable quaternary interactions that inhibit CXCL8 dimerization. In demonstrating the success of our computational method, our results argue that these unfavorable motifs have been evolutionarily conserved to specifically disfavor one dimerization state and, as a result, indirectly contribute to favoring another

	18783728, epatoprotective activity of Amaranthus spinosus in experimental animals.The hepatoprotective and antioxidant activity of 50% ethanolic extract of whole plant of Amaranthus spinosus (ASE) was evaluated against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced hepatic damage in rats. The ASE at dose of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg were administered orally once daily for fourteen days. The substantially elevated serum enzymatic levels of serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (AST), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (ALT), serum alkaline phosphatase (SALP) and total bilirubin were restored towards normalization significantly by the ASE in a dose dependent manner. Higher dose exhibited significant hepatoprotective activity against carbon tetrachloride induced hepatotoxicity in rats. The biochemical observations were supplemented with histopathological examination of rat liver sections. Meanwhile, in vivo antioxidant activities as malondialdehyde (MDA), hydroperoxides, reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were also screened which were also found significantly positive in a dose dependent manner. The results of this study strongly indicate that whole plants of A. spinosus have potent hepatoprotective activity against carbon tetrachloride induced hepatic damage in experimental animals. This study suggests that possible mechanism of this activity may be due to the presence of flavonoids and phenolics compound in the ASE which may be responsible to hepatoprotective activity

	18786523, leurotus ostreatus, an oyster mushroom, decreases the oxidative stress induced by carbon tetrachloride in rat kidneys, heart and brain.The present work is aimed at evaluating the protective effect of the oyster mushroom, Pleurotus ostreatus on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced toxicity in male Wistar rats. Significantly elevated mean levels (p&lt;0.05) of malondialdehyde (MDA) and lowered mean levels (p&lt;0.01) of reduced glutathione (GSH), vitamins C and E (p&lt;0.05) were observed in kidneys, heart and brain of rats exposed to CCl4, when compared to values in normal rats. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) revealed lower activities of these antioxidant enzymes in the kidneys, heart and brain of rats exposed to CCl4. When the extract of P. ostreatus was used to treat rats with CCl4-induced toxicity, it lowered the mean level of MDA, elevated the mean levels of GSH and of vitamins C and E and enhanced the mean activities of CAT, SOD, Gpx and GST so that the values of most of these parameters did not differ significantly from those of normal rats. Histopathological studies confirmed the toxic effects of CCl4 on other organs such as kidneys, heart and brain and also tissue protective effect of the extract of P. ostreatus. These results suggest that an extract of P. ostreatus is able to alleviate the oxidative damage caused by CCl4 in the kidneys, heart and brain of Wistar rats

	18787281, epatoprotective effects of setarud against carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury in rats.To assess the hepatoprotective activity of a new herbal drug  setarud  in experimental liver fibrosis, 48 male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: controls, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) group, and two treatment groups that received CCl4 and setarud at doses of 0.02 or 0.04 g/Kg/day for 30 days. Body weight gain, biochemical liver tests, bile flow rate and composition, and changes in liver morphology in the four groups were studied. CCl4 administration led to morphological and biochemical evidence of liver injury as compared to untreated controls. Setarud administration led to significant protection against CCl4-induced changes in body weight gain, liver morphology, bile flow and concentration. It was also associated with significantly lower serum liver enzyme levels (p&lt;0.01), higher serum albumin level, and reduced increase in narcotic-induced sleeping time. Thus, setarud showed protective activity against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. Further studies of its efficacy in liver disease are warranted

	18788625, Dendritic cell vaccine modified by murine mAFP gene enhances immunoprotective effect on liver carcinogenesis and tumor development in mice]OBJECTIVE: To construct a dendritic cell vaccine transduced by murine alpha-fetoprotein (mAFP) gene, and evaluate its immunoprotective effect on C57BL/6J mice during the induction of hepatocellular carcinoma by diethylnitrosamines, carbon tetrachloride and ethanol. METHODS: Dendritic cells (DCs) were induced and augmented by murine IL-4 and GM-CSF, and transfected by recombinant adenovirus engineered with mAFP gene. Major MHC class I and II, B7.1 (CD80), B7.2 (CD86), CD18a, and CD54 molecules on DC were analyzed by FACS. 80 C57BL/6J male mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (20 mice per group): Simple DC inoculated group, pAdBM5-mAFP-DC inoculated group, pAdBM5-mAFP plasmid inoculated group, and PBS control group. They were immunized once with 5 x 10(5) DCs (0.1 ml)/mouse administered s. c. in the left flank or 100 mg pAdBMS-mAFP plasmid/mouse administered i. m. in the left tibialis anterior muscle. Inoculation was conducted once a week for 4 weeks after 3 times consecutive immunization initially. At the same time of immunization, DEN/CCl4/ethanol were given to induce hepatocellular carcinoma. Tumor incidence was assessed after 20 weeks. RESULTS: A transgenic DC vaccine was successfully constructed and the mAFP transgenic DCs expressed high level molecules of major MHC class I and II , B7.1, B7.2, CD18a, and CD54. After the 20-week induction, the incidence of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PLC) was 70.0% in simple DC inoculated group, 25.0% in pAdBMS-mAFP-DC inoculated group, 65.0% in pAdBM5-mAFP plasmid inoculated group, and 75.0% in PBS control group. There was a significant difference between group B and other groups (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: mAFP transgenic DC tumor vaccine inoculation may induce strong immunoprotection against liver carcinogenesis and tumor development and reduce PLC incidence induced by DEN/CCl4/ethanol

	18807754, ntioxidant and hepatoprotective activity of tubers of Momordica tuberosa Cogn. against CCl4 induced liver injury in rats.Hydro alcoholic extract of tubers of M. tuberosa was subjected to preliminary phytochemical screening and evaluated for in vitro and in vivo antioxidant and hepatoprotective activity against CCl4 induced liver damage in rats. Pretreatment with 70% ethanolic extract of M. tuberosa reversed CCl4 induced elevation of levels of serum biomarkers to near normal levels, suggesting that the tubers of M. tuberosa possess hepatoprotective property and this property may be attributed to the antioxidant property of the plant

	18807755, ffect of Phyllanthus niruri Linn. treatment on liver, kidney and testes in CCl4 induced hepatotoxic rats.Phyllanthus niruri extract is extensively used in treating liver ailments. Effects of aqueous extract of P. niruri on liver, kidney and testes of CCl4 induced hepatotoxic rats were studied. High levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) were observed in the CCl4 test group with significant reduction of MDA levels in all groups on P. niruri extract administration. Highest levels of glutathione (GSH) were found in P. niruri group. Activities of alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase enzymes were significantly reduced in the curative group (P. niruri treatment after CCl4 injection). Histopathology of liver showed lesser degree of inflammation in all P. niruri treated groups while the renal and seminiferous tubules showed eosinophilic protein casts with signs of tubular damage and degeneration. Testes also showed decreased amount of mature spermatozoa. The results suggest that P. niruri has anti-oxidant and hepato-protective activity with associated deleterious effects on kidney and testes

	18811677, rolox down-regulates transforming growth factor-beta and prevents experimental cirrhosis.Cirrhosis is a very common disease and its treatment is limited due to lack of effective drugs. Some studies indicate that this disease is associated with oxidative stress. Therefore, we decided to study the effect of trolox, an effective antioxidant, on experimental cirrhosis. Cirrhosis was induced by CCl4 administration (0.4 g/kg, intraperitoneally, three times per week, for 8 weeks) to Wistar male rats. Trolox was administered daily (50 mg/kg, orally). Fibrosis was assessed histologically and by measuring liver hydroxyproline content. Glutathione, lipid peroxidation and glycogen were measured in liver; serum markers of liver damage were also quantified. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) was determined by Western blot and quantified densitometrically. Alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and alanine aminotransferase increased in the group receiving CCl4; trolox completely or partially prevented these alterations. Glycogen was almost depleted by CCl4 but was partially preserved by trolox. Lipid peroxidation increased while glutathione decreased by CCl4 administration; trolox corrected both effects. Histology showed thick bands of collagen, necrosis and distortion of the hepatic parenchyma in the CCl4 group, such effects were prevented by trolox. Hydroxyproline content increased 5-fold by CCl4, while the group receiving both CCl4 and trolox showed no significant difference compared to the control group. CCl4 increased 3-fold TGF-beta, while trolox completely prevented this increase. We found that trolox effectively prevented cirrhosis induced with CCl4 in the rat. Our results suggest that the beneficial effects of trolox may be associated to its antioxidant properties and to its ability to reduce the profibrogenic cytokine TGF-beta expression

	18812033, rotective effects of total flavonoids of Bidens bipinnata L. against carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis in rats.Bidens bipinnata L. is well known in China as a traditional Chinese medicine and has been used to treat hepatitis in clinics for many years. In a previous study we found that total flavonoids of Bidens bipinnata L. (TFB) had a protective effect against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced acute liver injury in mice. Now this study was designed to investigate its therapeutic effect against CCl4-induced liver fibrosis in rats and to determine, in part, its mechanism of action. The liver fibrosis model was established by subcutaneous injection of 50% CCl4 twice a week for 18 weeks. TFB (40, 80 and 160 mg kg(-1)) was administered by gastrogavage daily from the 9th week. The results showed that TFB (80 and 160 mg kg(-1)) treatment for 10 weeks significantly reduced the elevated liver index (liver weight/body weight) and spleen index (spleen weight/body weight), elevated levels of serum transaminases (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase), hyaluronic acid, type III procollagen and hepatic hydroxyproline. In addition, TFB markedly inhibited CCl4-induced lipid peroxidation and enhanced the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. Moreover, TFB (80 and 160 mg kg(-1)) treatment improved the morphologic changes of hepatic fibrosis induced by CCl4 and suppressed nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) protein expression and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 gene expression in the liver of liver fibrosis of rats. In conclusion, TFB was able to ameliorate liver injury and protect rats from CCl4-induced liver fibrosis by suppressing oxidative stress. This process may be related to inhibiting the induction of NF-kappaB on hepatic stellate cell activation and the expression of TGF-beta1

	18823437, ietary trans-resveratrol bioavailability and effect on CCl4-induced liver lipid peroxidation.BACKGROUND AND AIM: Several in vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of pure trans-resveratrol (t-Res) to act as an anti-oxidant, but the scientific literature is lacking in in vivo studies dealing with dietary t-Res bioavailability in oxidative stress models. Our aim was to investigate the bioavailability of t-Res from dietary sources and its effect on an animal model of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver lipid peroxidation. METHODS: Ten rats were intragastrically administered for 14 days with a grape-stalk extract determining a daily t-Res dosage of 3 mg/kg. The control group (10 rats) was daily injected with the vehicle solvent without the t-Res extract. After 1 week, the induction of liver lipid peroxidation by CCl4 injection was carried out. Serum and liver samples, at different time intervals, were collected to evaluate t-Res content, by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectometry-mass spectometry (LC-MS-MS). Liver malondialdehyde (MDA) as marker of oxidative stress was measured. RESULTS: t-Res accumulates in the liver reaching 49.8 +/- 10.2 ng/g after 7 days and 191.8 +/- 15.3 ng/g after 14 days. No t-Res was detected in serum. The increase of MDA liver concentration due to CCl4 injection after 24 h and 1 week was reduced by 38% and a 63%, respectively, by the treatment with the t-Res extract. CONCLUSIONS: A moderate consumption of t-Res from a dietary source resulted in a time-dose-dependent liver accumulation. It was able to counteract in vivo CCl4-induced liver lipid peroxidation thus demonstrating the hepatoprotective property of t-Res

	18829979, uperoxide dismutase gene transfer reduces portal pressure in CCl4 cirrhotic rats with portal hypertension.BACKGROUND: Increased intrahepatic vascular tone in cirrhosis has been attributed to a decrease of hepatic nitric oxide (NO) secondary to disturbances in the post-translational regulation of the enzyme eNOS. NO scavenging by superoxide (O(2)(-)) further contributes to a reduction of NO bioavailability in cirrhotic livers. AIM: To investigate whether removing increased O(2)(-) levels could be a new therapeutic strategy to increase intrahepatic NO, improve endothelial dysfunction and reduce portal pressure in cirrhotic rats with portal hypertension. METHODS: Adenoviral vectors expressing extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD) (AdECSOD) or beta-galactosidase (Adbetagal) were injected intravenously in control and CCl(4)-induced cirrhotic rats. After 3 days, liver O(2)(-) levels were determined by dihydroethidium staining, NO bioavailability by hepatic cGMP levels, nitrotyrosinated proteins by immunohistochemistry and western blot, and endothelial function by responses to acetylcholine in perfused rat livers. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and portal pressure were evaluated in vivo. RESULTS: Transfection of cirrhotic livers with AdECSOD produced a significant reduction in O(2)(-) levels, a significant increase in hepatic cGMP, and a decrease in liver nitrotyrosinated proteins which were associated with a significant improvement in the endothelium-dependent vasodilatation to acetylcholine. In addition, in cirrhotic livers AdECSOD transfection produced a significant reduction in portal pressure (17.3 (SD 2) mm Hg vs 15 (SD 1.6) mm Hg; p&lt;0.05) without significant changes in MAP. In control rats, AdECSOD transfection prevents the increase in portal perfusion pressure promoted by an ROS-generating system. CONCLUSIONS: In cirrhotic rats, reduction of O(2)(-) by AdECSOD increases NO bioavailability, improves intrahepatic endothelial function and reduces portal pressure. These findings suggest that scavenging of O(2)(-) might be a new therapeutic strategy in the management of portal hypertension

	18830880, ntioxidant and hepatoprotective potential of Aegle marmelos Correa. against CCl4-induced oxidative stress and early tumor events.The antioxidant properties and inhibitory effect on early tumor promoter markers of A. marmelos (25 and 50 mg/Kg b. wt. orally) have been evaluated. Male Wistar rats were pre-treated for seven consecutive days with A. marmelos prior to CCl4 (1 mL Kg(- 1) body weight p. o., in corn oil [1:1 v/v]) treatment. Pre-treatment with A. marmelos suppressed lipid peroxidation (LPO), xanthine oxidase (XO) and release of serum toxicity marker enzymes viz, SGOT, LDH, SGPT dose-dependently and significantly (p &lt; 0.001). Hepatic antioxidant status viz, reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), quinone reductase (QR), catalase (CAT) were concomitantly restored in A. marmelos-treated groups (p &lt; 0.001). In addition, A. marmelos pretreatment also prevented the CCl4-enhanced ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and hepatic DNA synthesis significantly (p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, carbon tetrachloride-induced liver toxicity was strikingly attenuated by A. marmelos treatment and the study gives some insight into the mechanisms involved in diminution of free radical generating toxicants and enhancement of the antioxidant armory, hence preventing further tissue damage, injury and hyperproliferation. Thus, these findings indicate that A. marmelos attenuates CCl4-mediated hepatic oxidative stress, toxicity, tumor promotion and subsequent cell proliferation response in Wistar rats

	18937455,  3-fold  butterfly valve  in command of the encapsulation's kinetic stability. Molecular baskets at work.Molecular basket 1, composed of a semirigid tris-norbornadiene framework and three revolving pyridine-based gates at the rim, has been built to  dynamically  enclose space and as such regulate molecular encapsulation. The gates were shown to fold via intramolecular hydrogen bonding and thereby form a C3nu symmetrical receptor: the 1H NMR resonance for the amide N-H protons of the pyridine gates appeared downfield (delta= 10.98 ppm), and the N-H vibrational stretch (IR) was observed at 3176 cm(-1). Accordingly, density functional theory (DFT, B3LYP) investigations revealed for the closed conformers of 1 to be energetically the most stable and dominant. The gearing of the pyridine  gates , about their axis, led to the interconversion of two dynamic enantiomers 1A and 1B comprising the clockwise and counterclockwise seam of intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Dynamic 1H NMR spectroscopic measurements and line-shape simulations suggested that the energy barrier of 10.0 kcal/mol (DeltaG++(A/B), 298 K) is required for the 1A/B interconversion, when CCl4 occupies the cavity of 1. Likewise, the activation free energy for CCl4 departing the basket was found to be 13.1 kcal/mol (DeltaG++, 298 K), whereas the thermodynamic stability of 1:CCl4 complex was -2.7 kcal/mol (DeltaGdegrees, 298 K). In view of that, CCl4 (but also (CH3)3CBr) was proposed to escape from, and a molecule of solvent to enter, the basket when the gates rotate about their axis: the exit of CCl4 requires the activation energy of 12.7 kcal/mol (DeltaG++(A/B) + DeltaGdegrees), similar to the experimentally found 13.1 kcal/mol (DeltaG++)

	18949895, epatoprotective effect of Hibiscus hispidissimus Griffith, ethanolic extract in paracetamol and CCl4 induced hepatotoxicity in Wistar rats.Hibiscus hispidissimus Griff. is used in tribal medicine of Kerala, the southern most state of India, to treat liver diseases. In the present study, the effect of the ethanolic extract of Hibiscus hispidissimus whole plant on paracetamol (PCM)-induced and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver damage in healthy Wistar albino rats was studied. The results showed that significant hepatoprotective effects were obtained against liver damage induced by PCM and CCl4 as evidenced by decreased levels of serum enzymes, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), serum alkaline phosphatase (SAKP), serum bilirubin (SB) and an almost normal histological architecture of the liver of the treated groups compared to the toxin controls. The extract also showed significant antilipid peroxidant effects in vitro, besides exhibiting significant activity in quenching 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) radical, indicating its potent antioxidant effects

	18971186, Comparison of two rat models of IgA nephropathy]OBJECTIVE: To study the methods for rapid establishment of rat models of IgA nephropathy. METHODS: Forty female SD rats weighing 160-200 g were randomized into 3 groups. In group A, the rats received intravenous injection of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) and oral bovine serum albumin (BSA), and in group B, CCl4 was injected subcutaneously in addition to the above treatments; the rats in group C received no treatments to serve as the normal control group. The rats were sacrificed 10 and 14 weeks after the treatment for biochemical testing of the arterial blood and histopathological and IgA immunofluorescence examination of the renal tissues. The twenty-four-hour urine was collected at 10, 12, and 14 weeks after the treatments for detecting the urine proteins. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the rats in groups A and B showed significantly increased serum creatinine, urine nitrogen and protein levels. Pathological examination of the renal tissue showed mild to moderate mesangial expansion and mesangial cell proliferation in groups A and B, without obvious difference between the two groups; but hematuria and proteinuria occurred earlier in group B with stronger IgA immunofluorescence than in group A. CONCLUSION: Both of the methods used in group A and group B can successfully induce IgA nephropathy in rats, but in group B, hematuria and urineprotein occurs earlier and IgA immunofluorescence is more stronger. Therefore intravenous SEB injection combined with oral BSA and subcutaneous CCl4 administration is a better method for time-efficient establishment of rat models of IgA nephropathy

	18989868, ral administration of diphenyl diselenide potentiates hepatotoxicity induced by carbon tetrachloride in rats.Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) is a model for studying free radical-induced liver injury and screening hepato-protective drugs. Numerous studies have reported the involvement of oxidative stress in CCl4-induced liver damage and the hepato-protective effects mediated by different antioxidants. The present study examined the effects of diphenyl diselenide, (PhSe)2, on hepatotoxicity induced by CCl4 in rats. To this end, male Wistar rats received (PhSe)2 by oral route at the dosage of 31.2 mg/kg for one or two days. After the second day of treatment, rats received CCl4 orally in a single dose. The liver and kidney were utilized for determination of histopathology, biochemical [aspartate (ALT) and alanine (AST) aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirrubin (TB) and gamaglutamyl transferase (GGT)] and toxicological parameters [thiobarbituric reactive species (TBARS) levels, catalase activity, ascorbic acid, nonprotein thiols (NPSH) and aminolevulinate dehydratase (-ALA-D) activity]. Repeated administration of (PhSe)2 caused a marked potentiation of hepatotoxicity induced by CCl4 exposure, as manifested by an increase in biochemical parameters (AST, ALT, ALP, GGT and BT) and severe alteration in histopathology. This study also demonstrated a potentiation of TBARS levels and a consequent depletion of important antioxidant defenses including catalase and ascorbic acid. Pre-treatment with a single dose of (PhSe)2 prevented the effect of strychnine, a substrate for CYPs, abolishing lethality in mice. This result indicates that (PhSe)2 prevented animal death, suggesting an activator action of (PhSe)2 in CYPs. This study clearly indicates that (PhSe)2 potentiated acute hepatic damage induced by CCl4

	18996463, ction mechanism of Yi Guan Jian Decoction on CCl4 induced cirrhosis in rats.AIM OF STUDY: To investigate action mechanism of Yi Guan Jian Decoction on cirrhosis induced by CCl(4) in rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: CCl(4) (3 mL/kg) for the first time and then olive oil CCl(4) solution 50% (2 mL/kg) was administered hypodermically to rats twice each week for 12 weeks. At the end of 8th week, rats were randomly divided into CCl(4) control group (n=10), Yi Guan Jian Decoction group (n=9) and Xiao Chai Hu Decoction group (n=9). Yi Guan Jian Decoction and Xiao Chai Hu Decoction were oral administrated per day respectively for 4 weeks, concomitantly continued CCl(4) administration. At 12th weekend, the rats were sacrificed for sampling and detection of liver function, histological changes of liver tissue, liver tissue hydroxyproline content and expression of alpha-SMA, CD68, MMP-13, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, Caspase-12, HGFalpha, MMP-2, MMP-9 and hepatocyte apoptotic index. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: (1) Compared with that of normal rats, expression of alpha-SMA, CD68 and TIMP-1 in liver tissue of 8 week model group rats increases significantly (P&lt;0.01), moreover further increased in the 12 week of model group. However, MMP-13, HGFalpha, TIMP-2 content decreases gradually and the statistical difference is seen between each time point (P&lt;0.01). Activity of MMP-2, MMP-9, content of Caspase-12 and hepatocyte apoptotic index increased gradually at 4th, 8th, 12th week. (2) Compared to that of the same time point model group, activity of MMP-9 and contents of MMP-13, TIMP-2 and HGFalpha in Yi Guan Jian Decoction group improves significantly (P&lt;0.01), and activity of MMP-2 and contents of alpha-SMA, TIMP-1, Caspase-12 and hepatocyte apoptotic index decreases significantly (P&lt;0.01). This work suggests that Yi Guan Jian Decoction exerts significant therapeutic effect on CCl(4)-induced cirrhosis in rats, through mechanism of inhibiting hepatocytes apoptosis and hepatic stellate cells activation, and regulating the function of Kupffer cell. ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: This study investigates the mechanism of Yi Guan Jian against cirrhosis from aspect of heptocytes apoptosis and hepatic stellate cells activation. It suggest that although of unknown bioactive ingredients, mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine recipe against cirrhosis can be disclosed and of profound significance

	19001734, Curative effect of interferon-alpha on rat liver fibrosis induced by CCl4]OBJECTIVE: To explore the curative effect and the mechanism of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) on rat liver fibrosis induced by CCl4. METHODS: Thirty-nine male SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups. The rats in the normal control group (n=10) received subcutaneous injection of peanut oil (0.003 mL/g body weight) for 10 weeks. Rat liver fibrosis was induced in 29 rats by 0.003 mL/g subcutaneous injection of 40% CCl4 (CCl4: peanut oil = 2:3), twice weekly for 10 weeks. In the 7th week, these 29 rats were randomly divided into a liver fibrosis group without treatment (n=15) and an IFN-alpha treatment group (n=14), which received subcutaneous injection of IFN-alpha-2b at 10(6) units per rat. The rats' liver tissue was collected and HE and Masson staining were performed to observe of pathological changes, stage of liver fibrosis,and semi-quantitative scoring. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of Collagen I, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA),and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in the rat liver. RESULTS: The stage of liver fibrosis, semi-quantitative scoring of Masson staining, and immunohistochemical staining of Collagen I in the liver fibrosis group were significantly higher than those of the normal controls (All P&lt;0.01), and those in the IFN-alpha treatment group were significantly lower than those of the liver fibrosis group(P&lt;0.05). The semi-quantitative immunohistochemical scoring of alpha-SMA and TGF-beta1 in the liver fibrosis group was significantly higher than those of the normal control (All P&lt;0.01), and that in the IFN-alpha treatment group was significantly lower than that of the liver fibrosis group (All P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Treatment of IFN-alpha can decrease the liver fibrogenesis induced by CCl4 in rats. The anti-fibrosis effect of IFN-alpha may be attributed to the inhibition of the hepatic stellate cells' activation to decrease TGF-beta1 expression

	19023974, holeretic activity of 2-demethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxycarbonyl-11-deoxymisoprostol on the model of CCl4-induced hepatitis.Therapeutic administration of 11-deoxymisoprostol had a hepatoprotective effect, which manifested in a decrease in the content of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase in blood plasma, and produced a choleretic effect in rats with CCI4-induced toxic hepatitis

	19034232, cute renal failure induced by carbon tetrachloride in rats with hepatic cirrhosis.Relationship between cirrhosis and renal dysfunction is not yet fully understood. A model of cirrhosis with acute hepatic and renal damage (RF), produced by CCl4 in rats, with hemodynamic and renal functional alterations, similar to those observed in decompensated cirrhosis (DC) in man, was used to study chemical nephrotoxicity in animals. We performed in male Wistar rats hepatic and renal functional and hemodynamic studies in control, cirrhotic and decompensated cirrhotic (DC) groups. Cirrhosis was induced with carbon tetrachloride by chronic administration. Association between liver and renal functional alterations was detected in rats with decompensated cirrhosis, showing fall in mean arterial pressure and reduction of glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction. Renal hemodynamics did not change in cirrhotic rats, similarly to what occurs in compensated cirrhotic patients. However, DC rats exhibited increased sodium, glucose and phosphate urinary excretions and decreased ATP in renal cortex. DC animals had severe hypoglycemia. There was an extensive liver fibrosis. Glomeruli had hypercellularity and tubules showed extensive vacuolization in cirrhotic and DC rats. The present study suggests that in this model, damage typical of acute tubular necrosis ensues in cirrhotic rats. We describe functional and morphological damage in liver and kidney in a model of cirrhosis that might predispose to the development of acute renal failure when an individual with hepatic damage is exposed in acute way to chemical toxicants

	19042008, hysical control on CCl4 and CHCl3 desorption from artificially contaminated and aged sediments with supercritical carbon dioxide.The long-term interactions of carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) and chloroform (CHCl(3)) with sediments that are low in organic matter (OM) are not well studied. In this study, CCl(4) and CHCl(3) were mixed with supercritical carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and loaded onto columns packed with two sediments with low OM and different textures, to establish contamination and achieve expedited artificial aging. The columns were subsequently leached with a simulated groundwater under hydraulically saturated conditions. Scanning electron microscopy was used to inspect the morphology of sediment single particles, determine the degree of particle association in aggregates and qualitatively estimate porosity and the possible diffusional pathways that might affect the overall contaminant desorption rates. Results demonstrated that most of contaminant inventories were rapidly released in the first pore volume of effluent, although a small portion of contaminants' total mass exhibited time-dependent desorption. The calculated K(d) values of CCl(4) or CHCl(3) partition were negligibly small. Both contaminants had similar transport behavior which was simulated well with a distributed (multiple)-rate (DR) statistical model. The model accounted for the apparent contaminant mass transfer through diffusional pathways of different lengths, towards the advective pores. The distribution of contaminant mass between equilibrium and kinetic fractions, the distribution of the individual rate constants, and the average rate constants calculated with the parameters of the gamma-distribution function (beta and eta) of the DR model, were sediment (texture) dependent. This indicated that contaminant desorption during the late stage of leaching was driven by concentration gradients (i.e., diffusion) within sediment matrix porosity

	19047106, hemokine markers predict biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer following prostatectomy.PURPOSE: Stratifying patients who have a high risk of prostate cancer recurrence following prostatectomy can potentiate the use of adjuvant therapy at an early stage. Inflammation has emerged as a mediator of prostate cancer metastatic progression. We hypothesized that chemokines can be biomarkers for distinguishing patients with high risk for biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In a nested case-control study, 82 subjects developed biochemical recurrence within 5 years of prostatectomy. Prostate tissues from 98 age-matched subjects who were recurrence-free following prostatectomy in the same period were the controls. A high-throughput lectin-based enrichment of prostate tissue enabled multiplex ELISA to identify the expression of three chemokines to discriminate the two patient populations. RESULTS: The expression of CX3CL1 and IL-15 in prostate tissue was associated with 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival following prostatectomy. However, the expression of chemokine ligand 4 (CCL4) was associated with biochemical recurrence. Multivariable logistic regression model combining preoperative prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, surgical margin, and seminal vesicle status with the three chemokines doubled the specificity of prediction at 90% sensitivity compared with use of the clinicopathologic variables alone (P &lt; 0.0001). Survival analysis yielded a nomogram that supported the use of CX3CL1, IL-15, and CCL4 in predicting 1-, 3-, and 5-year recurrence-free survival after prostatectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Each of the three chemokines can serve as independent predictors of biochemical recurrence. However, the combination of chemokine biomarkers plus clinicopathologic variables discriminated prostatectomy subjects for the probability of biochemical recurrence significantly better than clinicopathologic variables alone

	19053324, ile acids metabonomic study on the CCl4- and alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate-induced animal models: quantitative analysis of 22 bile acids by ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.Bile acids (BAs) are crucial for the diagnosis, follow-up, and prognostics of liver and intestinal disorders and other diseases affecting BA metabolism. A rapid, simple, and sensitive analytical method is needed to demonstrate the full metabolic profile and simultaneously determine the individual BAs in biological samples. In our present study, an ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) method has been established and validated for simultaneous quantitation of 22 BAs and a metabonomic study was performed based on the chemometric analysis of the serum samples from carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)- and alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT)-induced liver failure rats. The optimal chromatographic condition was effected by UPLC (Acquity UPLC BEH column, 1.7 microm, 2.1 mm x 100 mm) using a linear gradient elution system of methanol-5 mM ammonium acetate containing 0.01% acetic acid after a simple-step deproteinization by precipitation. The separation of the 22 BAs can be finished in less than 12 min, and the concentrations of these BAs in rat serums were simultaneously determined using a selective ions monitoring mode. The method was validated with respect to repeatability (relative standard deviation &lt; 9.78%) and accuracy (relative errors from -13.55 to 9.58%). The range of each BA was found from not detected (nd) to 8301 ng mL(-1), respectively. Furthermore, the developed method was successfully applied to the metabonomics analysis of BAs in CCl4- and ANIT-induced liver failure rats, using principle component analysis and canonical discriminant analysis. The serum samples from the two types of rat liver injury could be distinguished from each other and from the untreated animals according to the varieties of BAs. It indicated that the level of BAs could be considered as a sensitive parameter of hepatotoxicity induced by different chemical toxins. This novel metabonomics study of BAs based on the UPLC-MS profile provides not only an accurate quantitative assay of the serum concentrations of biomarkers but also a promising methodology for evaluation of liver injury

	19058329, estrictive model of compensated carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis in rats.AIM: To develop a simplified and quick protocol to induce cirrhosis and standardize models of partial liver resection in rats. METHODS: In Fischer F344 rats two modified protocols of phenobarbital-carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) (dilution 50%) gavage to induce cirrhosis (frequency adjusted according to weight, but each subsequent dose was systematically administered) were tested, i.e. the rapid and slow protocols. Prothrombin time (PT) and total bilirubin (TB) were also evaluated. Animals from the rapid group underwent 15% hepatectomy and animals from the slow group underwent 70% hepatectomy. RESULTS: Rapid protocol: This corresponded to 1 gavage/4 d over 6 wk (mortality 30%). Mean PT was 35.2+/-2.8 s (normal: 14.5 s), and mean TB was 1.8+/-0.2 mg/dL (normal: 0.1 mg/dL). Slow protocol: This corresponded to 1 gavage/6 d over 9 wk (mortality 10%). Mean PT was 11.8+/-0.2 s (normal: 14.5 s), and mean TB was 0.4+/-0.04 mg/dL (normal: 0.1 mg/dL). Pathological analyses were performed in both protocols which showed persistent cirrhosis at 3 mo. Rat mortality in the rapid gavage group who underwent 15% hepatectomy and in the slow gavage group who underwent 70% hepatectomy was 50% and 70%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our modified model is a simplified method to induce cirrhosis which is rapid (6 to 9 wk), efficient and stable up to 3 mo. Using this method,  Child Pugh A  or  Child Pugh BC  cirrhotic rats were obtained. Our models of cirrhosis and hepatectomy can be used in various situations focusing on postoperative survival

	19069636, one marrow cell transplant does not prevent or reverse murine liver cirrhosis.We tested the effect of bone marrow cell (BMC) transplantation in either preventing or reversing cirrhosis on an experimental model of chronic liver disease. Female Wistar rats were fed a liquid alcohol diet and received intraperitoneal injections of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) over 15 weeks. Ten animals (cell-treated group) received five injections of BMCs during the cirrhosis induction protocol (on the 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th weeks) and four animals received the cells after liver injury was established through tail vein. Nine animals (nontreated group) were submitted to the previously described protocols; however, they received vehicle injections. Analyses were performed to verify whether the infusion of cells was effective in preventing the development of cirrhosis in our model of induction, and if the cells could reverse cirrhosis once it was established. Hepatic architecture and fibrotic septa were analyzed in liver slices stained with hematoxilin &amp; eosin and Sirius red, respectively. Fibrosis quantification was measured by Sirius red histomorphometry. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed to detect the amount of tissue transglutaminase 2. Blood analyses were performed to assess liver injury and function by the assessment of alanine aminotransferase and albumin. Ultrasound was performed to analyze the portal vein caliber and presence of ascitis. Cirrhosis features (regenerative nodules and fibrous septa) were observed in histopathology after 15 weeks of continuous hepatic injury in nontreated and cell-treated groups. Collagen content, immunofluorescence analysis, and biochemical and ultrasound parameters were similar in nontreated and cell-treated groups; however, both groups showed significant differences compared to a normal control group. Cell infusions with bone marrow-derived cells seem to be ineffective in improving morphofunctional parameters of the liver when applied to chronic cases either during or after establishment of the hepatic lesion

	19069843, urcumin-induced recovery from hepatic injury involves induction of apoptosis of activated hepatic stellate cells.Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) undergo activation and transdifferentiation to myofibroblast like cells in liver injury, leading to liver fibrosis. During recovery from injury, activated HSCs may either revert back to quiescent state or undergo apoptosis or both. In the present study, we have examined whether recovery from hepatic injury involves apoptosis of activated HSCs and tested whether curcumin (the yellow pigment from Curcuma longa Linn.) promotes recovery from hepatic injury by inducing apoptosis of these cells. Hepatic injury was induced by CCl4 and apoptosis was studied in HSCs isolated from liver by MTT assay, DNA fragmentation, and DAPI and annexin staining. Hepatic recovery was assessed by measuring hepatic marker activities, such as serum GOT, GPT and protein. Hepatic recovery occurred within 4 weeks after inducing injury in untreated control, whereas curcumin treatment caused hepatic recovery within 2 weeks, as evidenced by the reduction of hepatic marker activities to near normal levels. HSCs isolated from liver of animals treated with curcumin showed maximum apoptotic marker activities in 2nd week, whereas in HSCs from untreated control recovering from injury, maximum apoptosis was observed in 4th week. Induction of apoptosis in vivo during hepatic recovery was also suggested by increase in caspase-3 activity. Treatment of isolated HSCs in culture with curcumin caused apoptosis during later stages confirming that curcumin induced apoptosis of activated HSCs and not in unactivated quiescent HSCs. These results suggested that hepatoprotective effect of curcumin causing recovery from injury involved apoptosis of activated HSCs

	19074730, igh-level expression of the T-cell chemokines CCL3 and CCL4 by chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells in nurselike cell cocultures and after BCR stimulation.In lymphatic tissues, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells are interspersed with CD68(+) nurselike cells (NLCs), T cells, and other stromal cells that constitute the leukemia microenvironment. However, the mechanism regulating colocalization of CLL and these accessory cells are largely unknown. To dissect the molecular cross talk between CLL and NLCs, we profiled the gene expression of CD19-purified CLL cells before and after coculture with NLCs. NLC coculture induced high-level expression of B-cell maturation antigen and 2 chemoattractants (CCL3, CCL4) by CLL cells. CCL3/CCL4 induction in NLC cocultures correlated with ZAP-70 expression by CLL cells. High CCL3/CCL4 protein levels were found in CLL cocultures with NLCs, and CCL3/CCL4 induction was abrogated by R406, a Syk inhibitor, suggesting that NLCs induce these chemokines via B-cell receptor (BCR) activation. BCR triggering also caused robust CCL3/CCL4 protein secretion by CLL cells. High CCL3 and CCL4 plasma levels in CLL patients suggest that this pathway plays a role in vivo. These studies reveal a novel mechanism of cross talk between CLL cells and their microenvironment, namely, the secretion of 2 T-cell chemokines in response to NLC coculture and BCR stimulation. Through these chemokines, CLL cells can recruit accessory cells and thereby actively create a supportive microenvironment

	19099152, n ultrasound and histomorphological analysis of experimental liver cirrhosis in rats.We investigated whether liver injury by dual exposure to ethanol and carbon tetrachloride (EtOH + CCl4) for 15 weeks would persist after hepatotoxic agents were removed (EtOH + CCl4/8wR). After 15 weeks of hepatic injury with ethanol (5.5%, m/v) and carbon tetrachloride (0.05, mL/kg, ip), 5 of 11 female Wistar rats were sacrificed. The other 6 rats were maintained for an additional 8 weeks without hepatotoxic agents. Ultrasonography showed increased liver echogenicity and dilation of portal vein caliber in both groups (EtOH + CCl4: 0.22 +/- 0.01 cm, P &lt; 0.001; EtOH + CCl4/8wR: 0.21 +/- 0.02 cm, P &lt; 0.01) vs control (0.16 +/- 0.02 cm). Histopathology showed regenerative nodules in both experimental groups. Histomorphometry revealed increased fibrosis content in both groups (EtOH + CCl4: 12.6 +/- 2.64%, P &lt; 0.001; EtOH + CCl4/8wR: 10.4 +/- 1.36%, P &lt; 0.05) vs control (2.2 +/- 1.21%). Collagen types I and III were increased in groups EtOH + CCl4 (collagen I: 2.5 +/- 1.3%, P &lt; 0.01; collagen III: 1.3 +/- 0.2%, P &lt; 0.05) and EtOH + CCl4/8wR (collagen I: 1.8 +/- 0.06%, P &lt; 0.05; collagen III: 1.5 +/- 0.8%, P &lt; 0.01) vs control (collagen I: 0.38 +/- 0.11%; collagen III: 0.25 +/- 0.06%). Tissue transglutaminase increased in both groups (EtOH + CCl4: 66.4 +/- 8%, P &lt; 0.01; EtOH + CCl4/8wR: 58.8 +/- 21%, P &lt; 0.01) vs control (7.9 +/- 0.8%). Cirrhosis caused by the association of CCl4-EtOH remained for at least 8 weeks after removal of these hepatotoxic agents. Ultrasound images can be a useful tool to evaluate advanced hepatic alterations

	19103522, rokineticin 1 induces CCL4, CXCL1 and CXCL8 in human monocytes but not in macrophages and dendritic cells.Prokineticin 1 and 2 (PROK1 and PROK2) are two small proteins largely expressed in inflammatory tissues and involved in monocyte activation and differentiation. The focus of this study was to evaluate whether PROK1 was able to induce chemokine secretion in human monocytes, in monocyte-derived macrophages and in monocyte-derived dendritic cells, an aspect not addressed thus far. Here, we show for the first time, using flow cytometry, that PROK receptors 1 and 2 are present on the surface of human monocytes. Subsequently, monocytes were selected to investigate the chemokine response after stimulation by PROK1. Our results show that only three chemokines (CCL4, CXCL1 and CXCL8) were significantly induced at both the transcript and protein level, and that PROK1 induces most potently CXCL8, in a dose-dependent manner. From a mechanistic point of view, by blocking independently Galphai protein or intracellular calcium, monocytes lose the ability to secrete CXCL8 in response to PROK1. Finally, we observed that CCL4, CXCL1 and CXCL8 secretion, following PROK1 induction, is only observed in monocytes and not in monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells. Our results demonstrate that, in vitro, the differentiation status of monocytes influences chemokine production after stimulation by PROK1, and that this chemokine production is geared toward a pro-inflammatory response. This could represent a novel amplification loop of leukocyte recruitment, extravasation and tissue invasion

	19112861, The role of chemokines CCL3/ MIP-1 alfa and CCL4/ MIP-1 beta in pathogenesis of dry eye syndrome]PURPOSE: To evaluate the concentration of chemokines CCL3/ MIP-1 alfa and CCL4/ MIP-1 beta in film tears in patients with dry eye syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Tears samples were collected from 62 patients with dry eye syndrome and 18 patients from control group. The concentration of chemokines in film tears were determined by immunoenzymatic assay ELISA. RESULTS: We found statistically increased levels of chemokines CCL3/ MIP-1 alfa and CCL4/ MIP-1 beta in film tears of patients with dry eye syndrom compared with control group. CONCLUSION: Inflammation may play role in pathogenesis of dry eye syndrome

	19134049, mbryonic stem cells reduce liver fibrosis in CCl4-treated mice.We transplanted undifferentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells into the spleens of carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-treated mice to determine their effects on liver fibrosis. Carbon tetrachloride at 0.5 ml/kg of body weight was injected intraperitoneally into C57BL/6 mice twice weekly for up to 20 weeks. Four weeks after the first injection, the mice were divided into two groups and those in group 1 received 1 x 10(5) ES cells genetically labelled with enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the spleens, while group 2 mice received 0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. In group 1, GFP-immunopositive cells were retained and found in areas of fibrosis in the liver, and reduced liver fibrosis was observed as compared with group 2. Secondary transplantation of ES cells at 12 weeks after the initial transplantation enhanced the reduction in liver fibrosis. No teratoma formation or uncontrolled growth of ES cells in organs, including the liver and spleen, was observed in any of the mice. In the livers of group 1 mice, metalloproteinase 9-immunopositive cells derived from ES cells as well as those from the recipient were observed. These cells were also found to be immunopositive for the hepatoblast marker Delta-like (DlK-1), a member of the DlK-1 family of transmembrane proteins. These results suggest that ES-based cell therapy is potentially useful for liver fibrosis treatment and that reduction in CCl(4)-induced liver fibrosis by transplantation of ES cells may be related closely to the emergence of metalloproteinase-producing hepatoblast-like cells

	19136384, ncreased susceptibility to exacerbated liver injury in hypercholesterolemic ApoE-deficient mice: potential involvement of oxysterols.The contribution of metabolic factors to the severity of liver disease is not completely understood. In this study, apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice were evaluated to define potential effects of hypercholesterolemia on the severity of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver injury. Under baseline conditions, hypercholesterolemic ApoE-/- mice showed increased hepatic oxidative stress (SOD activity/4-hydroxy-2-nonenal immunostaining) and higher hepatic TGF-beta1, MCP-1, and TIMP-1 expression than wild-type control mice. After CCl4 challenge, ApoE-/- mice exhibited exacerbated steatosis (Oil Red O staining), necroinflammation (hematoxylin-eosin staining), macrophage infiltration (F4/80 immunohistochemistry), and fibrosis (Sirius red staining and alpha-smooth muscle actin immunohistochemistry) and more severe liver injury [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase] than wild-type controls. Direct correlations were identified between serum cholesterol and hepatic steatosis, fibrosis, and ALT levels. These changes did not reflect the usual progression of the disease in ApoE-/- mice, since exacerbated liver injury was not present in untreated age-paired ApoE-/- mice. Moreover, hepatic cytochrome P-450 expression was unchanged in ApoE-/- mice. To explore potential mechanisms, cell types relevant to liver pathophysiology were exposed to selected cholesterol-oxidized products. Incubation of hepatocytes with a mixture of oxysterols representative of those detected by GC-MS in livers from ApoE-/- mice resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in total lipoperoxides and SOD activity. In hepatic stellate cells, oxysterols increased IL-8 secretion through a NF-kappaB-independent mechanism and upregulated TIMP-1 expression. In macrophages, oxysterols increased TGF-beta1 secretion and MCP-1 expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Oxysterols did not compromise cell viability. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that hypercholesterolemic mice are sensitized to liver injury and that cholesterol-derived products (i.e., oxysterols) are able to induce proinflammatory and profibrogenic mechanisms in liver cells

	19144177, araoxonase-1 is related to inflammation, fibrosis and PPAR delta in experimental liver disease.BACKGROUND: Paraoxonase-1 (PON1) is an antioxidant enzyme synthesized by the liver. It protects against liver impairment and attenuates the production of the pro-inflammatory monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). We investigated the relationships between hepatic PON1 and MCP-1 expression in rats with liver disease and explored the possible molecular mechanisms involved. METHODS: CCl4 was administered for up to 12 weeks to induce liver damage. Serum and hepatic levels of PON1 and MCP-1, their gene and protein expression, nuclear transcription factors, and histological and biochemical markers of liver impairment were measured. RESULTS: High levels of PON1 and MCP-1 expression were observed at 12th week in the hepatocytes surrounding the fibrous septa and inflammatory areas. CCl4-administered rats had an increased hepatic PON1 concentration that was related to decreased gene transcription and inhibited protein degradation. Decreased PON1 gene transcription was associated with PPARdelta expression. These changes were accompanied by increased hepatic MCP-1 concentration and gene expression. There were significant direct relationships between hepatic PON1 and MCP-1 concentrations (P = 0.005) and between PON1 and the amount of activated stellate cells (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results from this experimental model suggest a hepato-protective role for PON1 against inflammation, fibrosis and liver disease mediated by MCP-1

	19145348, epatoprotective properties of fractions from meadowsweet extract during experimental toxic hepatitis.Fractions of the extract from meadowsweet aerial parts in 70% ethanol exhibited hepatoprotective properties during CCl4-induced toxic hepatitis. This extract produced a normalizing effect on activity of enzymes, markers of cytolysis, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant defense system in liver cells. Fractionation of the extract was accompanied by dissociation of the effect. These changes reflect specific action of a complex of bioactive substances. The ethyl acetate and chloroform fractions from this extract were most potent. The effectiveness of these fractions by several parameters surpassed that of Carsil

	19152825, ethoxy VO-salen complex: in vitro antioxidant activity, cytotoxicity evaluation and protective effect on CCl4-induced oxidative stress in rats.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play crucial roles in normal physiological processes. However, the overproduction of ROS is involved in the onset of many degenerative diseases. Regarding this fact, discovery of new antioxidants is interesting for many research groups. In this study, we evaluated the antioxidant properties of a methoxy VO-salen (MetVO-salen) complex employing various in vitro systems. In addition, the cytotoxic effect of MetVO-salen was assessed based on MTT in treated K562 cells. In an in vivo approach, the protective effect of MetVO-salen against CCl(4)-induced oxidative stress in rats was also investigated in terms of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities, as well as in terms of the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH). Our results indicated that MetVO-salen has an effective capability in scavenging superoxide (O*2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) radicals in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo results also showed that the administration of MetVO-salen to the CCl(4)-treated rats caused a significant (222%) increase in SOD activity, a 59% enhancement in GSH content and a 31% decrease in the level of MDA compared to the CCl(4)-treated control rats. Overall, MetVO-salen appears to be an effective antioxidant and is quite suitable for further biological evaluation

	19230414, Prevention and treatment of experimental liver fibrosis in rats by Semen Hoveniae extracts]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevention and treatment of experimental liver fibrosis in rats by Semen Hoveniae extracts (SHE). METHODS: Rats liver fiborsis model was induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). SD rats were randomly divided into six groups: the normal control group, the model control group, the positive control group and the SHE groups. The level of serum procollgan type-III (PC-III), hyaluronic acid (HA), laminin (LN) and liver function were measured, respectively. Liver histological examination was made. RESULTS: SHE could ameliorate CCl4-induced liver fibrosis significantly. The lever of serum PC-III, HA, LN decreased and liver function was improved. The histological examination also demonstrated its anti-fibrotic effect. CONCLUSION: SHE have anti-fibrotic effect on liver in vivo, and may have potential value for clinical use

	19242656, he preventive effects of heparin-superoxide dismutase on carbon tetrachloride-induced acute liver failure and hepatic fibrosis in mice.In this study, the effects of heparin-superoxide dismutase conjugate (heparin-SOD) on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced acute liver failure and hepatic fibrosis were evaluated. To investigate the effects of heparin-SOD on acute liver failure, heparin-SOD was administered to CCl4-treated mice by intravenous injection. Biochemical indicators, such as glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase/glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GOT/GPT), GSH (glutathione), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined 24 h after CCl4 treatment. The development of CCl4-induced acute liver failure altered the redox state with a decreased hepatic GSH and increased formation of lipid peroxidative products, which were partially normalized by treatment with heparin-SOD or heparin + SOD. Compared with other groups, the acute liver injury of heparin-SOD group was significantly lessened (reduced activities of GOT/GPT, MDA, and increased activities of GSH). To investigate the effects of heparin-SOD on hepatic fibrosis, heparin-SOD and CCl4 were co-administered by intraperitoneal injection twice a week for 12 weeks. Histological and hepatic hydroxyproline examination revealed that heparin-SOD could significantly prevent the progression of hepatic fibrosis. Moreover, real-time PCR was used to determine transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), fibronectin, and collagen-I expression. Significantly, greater fibrosis and TGF-beta1, MMP-2, fibronectin, and collagen-I expression were found in the liver of CCl4-induced mice at the end of 12th week. Heparin-SOD could markedly attenuate the mRNA expression of TGF-beta1, MMP-2, and collagen-I. Western blots of tissue homogenates revealed that the protein expression of TGF-beta1 was substantially reduce also by heparin-SOD treatment. These results demonstrate that administration of heparin-SOD may be useful in the treatment and prevention of acute liver failure and hepatic fibrosis

	19250650, eactive nitrogen species switch on early extracellular matrix remodeling via induction of MMP1 and TNFalpha.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Liver injury leads to generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, which can react to produce peroxynitrite (ONOO-). We investigated whether ONOO- and its metabolites modulate extracellular matrix remodeling. METHODS: Stellate cells (HSC) were incubated with pure ONOO- or SIN-1 (a ONOO- donor). Western blot, nuclear in vitro transcription, Northern blot, qPCR, and promoter transactivation analysis for COL1A1 and COL1A2 were carried out. Rats were fed alcohol or injected with CCl4 to cause alcohol-induced liver injury and an early fibrogenic response. RESULTS: HSC incubated with ONOO- or SIN-1 showed similar viability, proliferation, COL1A1 and COL1A2 transcription rates, and mRNA levels as controls. There was a time- and dose-dependent down-regulation of collagen I and alpha-Sma proteins and up-regulation of MMP1 and TNFalpha, indicating decreased HSC activation. These effects were blocked by ONOO- scavengers. SIN-1 or ONOO- increased nitrosylation of MMP1/MMP13 and transactivation of the MMP1, MMP13, and TNFalpha promoters. A TNFalpha neutralizing antibody or GSH-ethyl ester blocked MMP1 promoter transactivation; whereas TNFalpha or l-buthionine sulfoximine, which depletes GSH, further enhanced it. Pretreatment with SIN-1 or ONOO- reduced the TGFbeta pro-fibrogenic response in HSC. In vivo experiments validated the protective role of ONOO- on the early fibrogenic response. However, highly activated HSC, such as myofibroblasts and HSC from chronic alcohol-fed rats, were resistant to the anti-fibrogenic actions of ONOO- due to higher levels of GSH, a ONOO- scavenger, overproduction of pro-fibrogenic TGFbeta, and reactive oxygen species. CONCLUSION: ONOO- could induce a protective mechanism in HSC in early stages of liver injury

	19256381, Catalytic reduction of CCl4 in water by Fe0 and amended Fe0]Various bimetallic reductants of Cu/Fe, Ag/Fe, Pd/Fe and Ni/Fe were prepared by plating Cu, Ag, Pd and Ni on the surface of Fe0. Reductive dechlorination of toxic pollutants of CCl4 in water with Fe0 and amended Fe0 by batch experiments was investigated. Results show that CCl4 in water can be rapidly dechlorinated by above five catalytic reductants, and the presence of Cu, Ag, Pd can enhance the dechlorination rate dramatically. The reaction of CCl4 with various reductants was followed the pseudo first order kinetics, and the dechlorination rate constant of CCl4 in water by Fe0, Cu/Fe, Ag/Fe, Pd/Fe and Ni/Fe was 0.0393, 0.0925, 0.158, 0.0496 and 0.0533 min(-1) respectively. The byproducts and pathway of dechlorination of CCl4 by Fe0 and amended Fe0 was identified by GC/MS. Results indicate that the products and dechlorination rate of CCl4 by various bimetallic reductants are varied. The main products are chloroform and dichloromethane in Cu/Fe and Ag/Fe system, and that is methane in Pd/Fe system. Hydrogenolysis is the dominant reaction pathway of CCl4 by Fe0 and amended Fe0

	19322917, elatonin ameliorates experimental hepatic fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride in rats.AIM: To investigate the protective effects of melatonin on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatic fibrosis in experimental rats. METHODS: All rats were randomly divided into normal control group, model control group treated with CCl4 for 12 wk, CCl4 + NAC group treated with CCl4 + NAC (100 mg/kg, i.p.) for 12 wk, CCl4 + MEL-1 group treated with CCl4 + melatonin (2.5 mg/kg) for 12 wk, CCl4 + MEL-2 group treated with CCl4 + melatonin (5.0 mg/kg) for 12 wk, and CCl4 + MEL-3 group treated with CCl4 + melatonin (10 mg/kg). Rats in the treatment groups were injected subcutaneously with sterile CCl4 (3 mL/kg, body weight) in a ratio of 2:3 with olive oil twice a week. Rats in normal control group received hypodermic injection of olive oil at the same dose and frequency as those in treatment groups. At the end of experiment, rats in each group were anesthetized and sacrificed. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and Van Gieson staining were used to examine changes in liver pathology. Serum activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and protein concentration were measured with routine laboratory methods using an autoanalyzer. Hydroxyproline (HYP) content in liver and malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels in liver homogenates were assayed by spectrophotometry. Serum hyaluronic acid (HA), laminin (LN), and procollagen III N-terminal peptide (PIIINP) were determined by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Pathologic grading showed that the fibrogenesis was much less severe in CCl4 + MEL3 group than in model control group (u = 2.172, P &lt; 0.05), indicating that melatonin (10 mg/kg) can significantly ameliorate CCl4-induced hepatic fibrotic changes. The serum levels of ALT and AST were markedly lower in CCl4 + MEL treatment groups (5, 10 mg/kg) than in model control group (ALT: 286.23 +/- 121.91 U/L vs 201.15 +/- 101.16 U/L and 178.67 +/- 103.14 U/L, P = 0.028, P = 0.007; AST: 431.00 +/- 166.35 U/L vs 321.23 +/- 162.48 U/L and 292.42 +/- 126.23 U/L, P = 0.043, P = 0.013). Similarly, the serum laminin (LN) and hyaluronic acid (HA) levels and hydroxyproline (HYP) contents in liver were significantly lower in CCl4 + MEL-3 group (10 mg/kg) than in model control group (LN: 45.89 +/- 11.71 microg/L vs 55.26 +/- 12.30 microg/L, P = 0.012; HA: 135.71 +/- 76.03 microg/L vs 201.10 +/- 68.46 microg/L, P = 0.020; HYP: 0.42 +/- 0.08 mg/g tissue vs 0.51 +/- 0.07 mg/g tissue, P = 0.012). Moreover, treatment with melatonin (5, 10 mg/kg) significantly reduced the MDA content and increased the GPx activity in liver homogenates compared with model control group (MDA: 7.89 +/- 1.49 noml/mg prot vs 6.29 +/- 1.42 noml/mg prot and 6.25 +/- 2.27 noml/mg prot, respectively, P = 0.015, P = 0.015; GPx: 49.13 +/- 8.72 U/mg prot vs 57.38 +/- 7.65 U/mg prot and 61.39 +/- 13.15 U/mg prot, respectively, P = 0.035, P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Melatonin can ameliorate CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats. The protective effect of melatonin on hepatic fibrosis may be related to its antioxidant activities

	19336974, arbon tetrachloride-induced hepatotoxicity in pregnant and lactating rats.Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) is well known to induce hepatotoxicity after being metabolized to trichloromethyl free radical ((.)CCl3) by CYP2E1. In the present study, the hepatotoxicity induced by a single oral dose (2,000 mg/kg) of CCl4 was compared between pregnant (gestation days (GD) 13 and 19) or postpartum (postpartum days (PPD) 1, 13 and 27) and non-pregnant rats. Hepatotoxicity in CCl4-treated pregnant rats evaluated by blood chemistry (alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities) and histopathological finding (area of damaged hepatocytes) was minimal on GD19, being weaker than that in non-pregnant rats. CYP2E1 expression in non-treated pregnant rats decreased as pregnancy progressed and reached minimum level on GD19. Thus, the degree of CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity roughly corresponded to CYP2E1 levels during pregnancy. After delivery, hepatotoxicity in CCl4-treated lactating rats was maximal on PPD13, being stronger than that in non-pregnant rats, and then it decreased slightly on PPD27. The CYP2E1 level in the non-treated lactating rats tended to increase but remained at lower levels until PPD13 compared with that in non-pregnant rats. Thus, the degree of CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity did not correspond to CYP2E1 levels during lactation. This suggests that during lactation, there may be certain factors other than CYP2E1 expression responsible for the degree of CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity

	19345057, rotective effects of transgene expressed human PON3 against CCl4-induced subacute liver injury in mice.Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in both initiation and progression of liver injury in almost all experimental and clinical liver diseases. Antioxidative therapy is therefore an effective means of preventing and attenuating oxidative stress related liver diseases. Human paraoxonase 3 (hPON3) is a lipid-associated enzyme with antioxidant activity. In the present study, hPON3 cDNA gene was cloned into pcDNA3.1 plasmid and electro-transferred into mouse skeletal muscle to maintain a higher serum PON3 activity. After gene delivery, serum PON3 activity was about 1.4 times higher than those of control and PON3 mRNA expression was also detected in mouse skeletal muscle. To investigate the role of hPON3 in protecting mice against liver injury, subacute liver injury model was induced by repeated CCl(4) administration and hPON3 gene was delivered into mouse skeletal muscle before progression or recovery phase, respectively, of liver injury. Afterwards, the mice were euthanized to evaluate liver marker enzymes, degrees of oxidative stress and liver histological architecture in order to reveal the effects of PON3 on subacute liver injury. In both damage phases, delivery of hPON3 gene significantly reduced serum aminotransferase level and improved liver histological architecture. Moreover, transgene expression of hPON3 attenuated oxidative stress by increasing hepatic glutathione content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, total antioxidant capability (T-AOC), and reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) level

	19352025, rotective effect of iridoid glucosides from Boschniakia rossica on acute liver injury induced by carbon tetrachloride in rats.The protective effect of iridoid glucosides from Boschniakia rossica (BRI) against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver injury was examined. CCl4 at a dose of 0.5 ml/kg of body weight was given intraperitoneally to rats to induce liver damage. The rats were sacrificed 16 h after the CCl4 injection. The CCl4 challenge caused a marked increase in the levels of serum animotransferases, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and of hepatic inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein, depleted reduced glutathione (GSH), and propagated lipid peroxidation. The liver antioxidative defense system, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR), as well as the cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) expression were suppressed, however. Preadministration of BRI reversed the significant changes of all liver function parameters induced by CCl4 and restored the liver CYP2E1 content and function. These results demonstrate that BRI produced a protective action on CCl4-induced acute hepatic injury via reduced oxidative stress, suppressed inflammatory response and improved CYP2E1 function in the liver

	19382721, epatoprotective activity of six polyherbal formulations in CCl4-induced liver toxicity in mice.To evaluate pretreatment of six polyherbal liquid formulations (PLFs) commercially available in India, on CCl4-induced liver injury, Swiss albino mice were treated for 7 days with distilled water or PLFs (2.6 and 5.2 ml/kg body weight/day, po) followed by single sc injection of 50% (v/v) CCl4 in arachis oil at a dose of 1 ml/kg. The serum biochemical parameters such as alanine transaminases, aspartate transaminases and alkaline phosphatase were estimated. Phenobarbitone-induced sleeping time and liver histopathology were also carried out. CCl4-treated animals showed significant increase in the levels of liver enzymes, phenobarbitone-induced sleeping time and revealed fatty changes and centrizonal necrosis on histological examination of liver indicating hepatic damage. When pretreated with PLFs at a dose of 5.2 ml/kg body weight/day, the CCl4-induced changes were significantly reversed. The pretreatment with PLFs can prevent acute liver damage induced by CCl4 only at a higher dose. Therefore, it is suggested that a dose adjustment of these PLFs may be necessary for their optimal effects in human liver diseases

	19383907, D38/CD31, the CCL3 and CCL4 chemokines, and CD49d/vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 are interchained by sequential events sustaining chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell survival.CD38 and CD49d are associated negative prognosticators in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Despite evidence that both molecules are involved in interactions occurring between CLL and normal cells in the context of CLL-involved tissues, a functional link is still missing. Using gene expression profiles comparing CD38(+)CD49d(+) versus CD38(-)CD49d(-) CLL cells, we showed overexpression of the CCL3 and CCL4 chemokines in cells from the former group. These chemokines were also up-regulated by CD38 signals in CLL; moreover, CCL3 was expressed by CLL cells from bone marrow biopsies (BMB) of CD38(+)CD49d(+) but not CD38(-)CD49d(-) cases. High levels of CCR1 and, to a lesser extent, CCR5, the receptors for CCL3 and CCL4, were found in CLL-derived monocyte-macrophages. Consistently, CCL3 increased monocyte migration, and CD68(+) macrophage infiltration was particularly high in BMB from CD38(+)CD49d(+) CLL. Conditioned media from CCL3-stimulated macrophages induced endothelial cells to express vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), the CD49d ligand, likely through tumor necrosis factor alpha overproduction. These effects were apparent in BMB from CD38(+)CD49d(+) CLL, where lymphoid infiltrates were characterized by a prominent meshwork of VCAM-1(+) stromal/endothelial cells. Lastly, CD49d engagement by VCAM-1 transfectants increased viability of CD38(+)CD49d(+) CLL cells. Altogether, CD38 and CD49d can be thought of as parts of a consecutive chain of events ultimately leading to improved survival of CLL cells

	19386599,  novel function of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor during rat liver regeneration and in growth-promoted hepatocytes in primary culture.Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) exhibits anti-fibrinolytic activity by removing C-terminal lysine residues from fibrin or plasminogen receptor proteins on the cellular surface, and plays an important role in the regulation of fibrinolysis. In this study, we examined the regulation of TAFI in hepatocytes during liver regeneration, and revealed its pivotal role in hepatocyte proliferation. In rat models, partial hepatectomy or carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced acute liver injury suppressed the levels of plasma TAFI activity and hepatic TAFI mRNA, whereas this operation markedly increased both the hepatic plasmin activity and the level of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. In primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, the TAFI mRNA level was decreased under growth-promoting culture conditions. Treatment of the hepatocytes with TAFI siRNA increased the amount of plasmin on the hepatocytes and promoted hepatocyte proliferation. We concluded that TAFI regulates plasmin activity through its enzymatic activity whereby it reduces the plasminogen-binding capacity of the hepatocytes. The TAFI gene expression is down-regulated in hepatocyte proliferation for producing a fibrinolytic microenvironment suitable for cell growth. This is the first report on the role of TAFI in the pericellular fibrinolysis necessary for cellular proliferation

	19394401, eutral sphingomyelinase-induced ceramide accumulation by oxidative stress during carbon tetrachloride intoxication.Ceramide is a biologically active lipid causing apoptosis in a variety of cells. In this study, we examined the effect of CCl4 on the ceramide metabolism and indicators of oxidative stress. After 12 h of oral administration of CCl4 (4 ml/kg body weight as a 1:1 mixture of CCl4 and mineral oil) to rats, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were increased. Antioxidants such as vitamins C and E were decreased in the liver and kidney. In addition, the ratio of GSH/GSSG in the liver, plasma, kidney, and brain decreased at 2h. The total ceramide in the liver significantly increased as early as 2h after CCl4 administration. After 24 and 36 h, the total ceramide in plasma and the kidney was also augmented. In the brain, the total ceramide dramatically increased at 36 h. These results suggested that the increased ceramide in plasma was transferred to the kidney and the brain. The activity of neutral sphingomyelinase (SMase), which was reported to be enhanced by the decrease of GSH, was significantly increased after CCl4 treatment in the liver, kidney, and brain. However, acid SMase activities were not increased in the liver and kidney. Thus, the activation of neutral SMase via oxidative stress induced the increase of ceramide during CCl4 intoxication in not only the liver but also other tissues. These results suggested that the excess accumulation of ceramide causes damage in other organs including the kidney and brain during fulminant hepatic failure

	19399744, he therapeutic potential of human umbilical mesenchymal stem cells from Wharton's jelly in the treatment of rat liver fibrosis.We investigated the effect of human umbilical mesenchymal stem cells (HUMSCs) from Wharton's jelly on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis in rats. Rats were treated with CCl4 for 4 weeks, and this was followed by a direct injection of HUMSCs into their livers. After 4 more weeks of CCl4 treatment (8 weeks in all), rats with HUMSC transplants [CCl4 (8W)+HUMSC liver] exhibited a significant reduction in liver fibrosis, as evidenced by Sirius red staining and a collagen content assay, in comparison with rats treated with CCl4 for 8 weeks without HUMSC transplants [CCl4 (8W)]. Moreover, rats in the CCl4 (8W)+HUMSC (liver) group had significantly lower levels of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic pyruvate transaminase, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and transforming growth factor-beta1 in the liver, whereas the expression of hepatic mesenchymal epithelial transition factor-phosphorylated type (Met-P) and hepatocyte growth factor was up-regulated, in comparison with the CCl4 (8W) group. Notably, engrafted HUMSCs scattered mostly in the hepatic connective tissue but did not differentiate into hepatocytes expressing human albumin or alpha-fetoprotein. Instead, these engrafted, undifferentiated HUMSCs secreted a variety of bioactive cytokines that may restore liver function and promote regeneration. Human cytokine assay revealed that the amounts of human cutaneous T cell-attracting chemokine, leukemia inhibitory factor, and prolactin were substantially greater in the livers of the CCl4 (8W)+HUMSC (liver) group, with considerably reduced hepatic inflammation manifested by a micro positron emission tomography scan. Our findings suggest that xenogeneic transplantation of HUMSCs is a novel approach for treating liver fibrosis and may be a promising therapeutic intervention in the future

	19405380, epato and reno protective action of Calendula officinalis L. flower extract.Flower extract of C. officinalis L. was evaluated for its protective effect against CCl4 induced acute hepatotoxicity and cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity. The activities of serum marker enzymes of liver injury like glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) which were increased by CCl4 injection was found to be significantly reduced by the pretreatment of the flower extract at 100 and 250 mg/kg body weight. The lipid peroxidation in liver, the marker of membrane damage and the total bilirubin content in serum were also found to be at significantly low level in the extract pretreated group, indicating its protective role. The kidney function markers like urea and creatinine were significantly increased in cisplatin treated animals. However, their levels were found to be lowered in the extract pretreated groups (100 and 250 mg/kg body weight). Moreover, cisplatin induced myelosuppression was ameliorated by the extract pretreatment. Treatment with the extract produced enhancement of antioxidant enzymes--superoxide dismutase and catalase and glutathione. Results suggest a protective role of the flower extract of C. officinalis against CCl4 induced acute hepatotoxicity and cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity. Extract has been found to contain several carotenoids of which lutein, zeaxanthin and lycopene predominates. Possible mechanism of action of the flower extract may be due to its antioxidant activity and reduction of oxygen radicals

	19409880, eptin enhances CC-chemokine ligand expression in cultured murine macrophage.Despite accumulating evidence, the role of leptin in chemokine expression is poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated the effects of leptin on CC-chemokine ligands (CCLs), CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 gene expression in cultured murine macrophage, J774A.1 cells. Expression of all these CCLs mRNA was gradually increased and significant up-regulation was observed for 3-12 h exposure to leptin (1 microM). The phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3) was significantly increased for 5-20 min exposure to leptin, and it was localized in leptin receptor-positive macrophage. Pretreatment with AG490 (100 microM), a janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor, significantly suppressed leptin-induced pSTAT3 increases and the up-regulation of CCLs mRNA expression. In conclusion, leptin enhances CCLs expression in cultured murine macrophage, through activation of a JAK2-STAT3 pathway. Therefore, a new paradigm of leptin-mediated chemokine expression may lead to the clarification of complex immune systems in future

	19420997, epatoprotective and curative properties of Kombucha tea against carbon tetrachloride-induced toxicity.Kombucha tea (KT) is sugared black tea fermented with a symbiotic culture of acetic acid bacteria and yeasts, which is said to be tea fungus. KT is claimed to have various beneficial effects on human health, but there is very little scientific evidence available in the literature. In the present study, KT along with black tea (BT) and black tea manufactured with tea fungus enzymes (enzyme-processed tea, ET) was evaluated for hepatoprotective and curative properties against CCl4-induced toxicity, using male albino rats as an experimental model by analyzing aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase in plasma and malondialdehyde content in plasma and liver tissues. Histopathological analysis of liver tissue was also included. Results showed that BT, ET, and KT have the potential to revert the CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity. Among the three types of teas tried, KT was found to be more efficient than BT and ET. Antioxidant molecules produced during the fermentation period could be the reason for the efficient hepatoprotective and curative properties of KT against CCI4-induced hepatotoxicity

	19422480, ffect of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells in a cirrhotic rat model.BACKGROUND/AIM: Cirrhosis is a long-term consequence of chronic hepatic injury and no effective therapy is currently available for this disease. Recent reports have shown that the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the capacity to differentiate into hepatocytes, and umbilical cord blood is a rich source of MSCs. Hence, we investigated the effect of infusing of human umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (HMSCs) in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced cirrhosis in a rat model. METHODS: The effect of HMSCs on cirrhosis was evaluated using haematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome staining. To evaluate cirrhosis-related factors, we measured protein and mRNA expression of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), collagen type I and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA). RESULTS: Histological findings showed that liver fibrosis in rats was alleviated by HMSCs infusion. Interestingly, CM-DiI-labelled HMSCs expressed the hepatocyte-specific markers, human albumin and alpha-fetoprotein. Infusion of HMSCs significantly inhibited TGF-beta1, collagen type I and alpha-SMA expressions in CCl4-induced cirrhotic rats. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that HMSCs infusion could improve liver fibrosis in rats with CCl4-induced cirrhosis, raising the possibility for clinical use of HMSCs in the treatment of cirrhosis

	19424597, xpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in CCL4-induced rat liver fibrosis.The renin angiotensin system (RAS) plays a major role in liver fibrosis. A novel homologue of angiotensin converting enzyme, ACE2, was identified as a negative regulator of RAS as it degrades Ang II to Ang1-7. We investigated in vivo the expression of ACE2 in liver fibrosis. We evaluated the relationship between biochemical variables and liver tissue expression of ACE2, the correlation between a histological assessment of liver fibrosis and liver tissue expression of ACE2. Male SD rats were randomly divided into a CCL4 group which received injections of CCL4 and the control group which received injections of olive oil. Liver pathology was examined by H&amp;E and Sirius red staining, and real-time PCR was performed to determine the gene expression levels of ACE2 and ACE. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that ACE2 mRNA was higher at the two-, four-, and six-week time points, respectively (p&lt;0.01). Similarly, hepatic ACE mRNA was significantly increased after CCL4 injection. There was a significant correlation between ACE and ACE2 gene expression (r=0.750, P&lt;0.001). ACE2 gene expression strongly correlated with ALT (r=0.669, P&lt;0.0001) and AST levels (r=0.815, P&lt;0.0001). There was a significant correlation between circulating ACE2 and histological scores of liver fibrosis. ACE2 and ACE gene expression correlated with the ISHAK score (r=0.850, P&lt;0.001; r=0.806, P&lt;0.001). There was a significant relationship between ACE2 gene expression and the degree of liver fibrosis. ACE2 plays a crucial role in liver fibrogenesis

	19452445, nvolvement of IQGAP3, a regulator of Ras/ERK-related cascade, in hepatocyte proliferation in mouse liver regeneration and development.The spatio-temporal regulation of hepatocyte proliferation is a critical issue in liver regeneration. Here, in normal and regenerating liver as well as in developing liver, we examined its expression/localization of IQGAP3, which was most recently reported as a Ras/Rac/Cdc42-binding proliferation factor associated with cell-cell contacts in epithelial-type cells. In parallel, the expression/localization of Rac/Cdc42-binding IQGAP1/2 was examined. IQGAP3 showed a specific expression in proliferating hepatocytes positive for the proliferating marker Ki-67, the levels of expressions of mRNAs and proteins were significantly increased in hepatocytes in liver regeneration and development. In immunofluorescence, IQGAP3 was highly enriched at cell-cell contacts of hepatocytes. IQGAP1 and IQGAP2 were exclusively expressed in Kupffer and sinusoidal endothelial cells, respectively, in normal, regenerating, and developing liver. The expression of IQGAP1, but not of IQGAP2, was increased in CCl4-induced (but not in partial hepatectomy-induced) liver regeneration. Exclusive expression/localization of IQGAP3 to hepatocytes in the liver likely reflects the specific involvement of the IQGAP3/Ras/ERK signaling cascade in hepatocyte proliferation in addition to the previously identified signaling pathways, possibly by integrating cell-cell contact-related proliferating signaling events. On the other hand, the Rac/Cdc42-binding properties of IQGAP1/2/3 may be related to the distinct modes of remodeling due to the different strategies which induced proliferation of liver cells; partial hepatectomy, CCl4 injury, or embryonic development. Thus, the functional orchestration of Ras and the Ras homologous (Rho) family proteins Rac/Cdc42 likely plays a critical role in liver regeneration and development

	19479036, D152 (CTLA-4) determines CD4 T cell migration in vitro and in vivo.BACKGROUND: Migration of antigen-experienced T cells to secondary lymphoid organs and the site of antigenic-challenge is a mandatory prerequisite for the precise functioning of adaptive immune responses. The surface molecule CD152 (CTLA-4) is mostly considered as a negative regulator of T cell activation during immune responses. It is currently unknown whether CD152 can also influence chemokine-driven T cell migration. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed the consequences of CD152 signaling on Th cell migration using chemotaxis assays in vitro and radioactive cell tracking in vivo. We show here that the genetic and serological inactivation of CD152 in Th1 cells reduced migration towards CCL4, CXCL12 and CCL19, but not CXCL9, in a G-protein dependent manner. In addition, retroviral transduction of CD152 cDNA into CD152 negative cells restored Th1 cell migration. Crosslinking of CD152 together with CD3 and CD28 stimulation on activated Th1 cells increased expression of the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CCR7, which in turn enhanced cell migration. Using sensitive liposome technology, we show that mature dendritic cells but not activated B cells were potent at inducing surface CD152 expression and the CD152-mediated migration-enhancing signals. Importantly, migration of CD152 positive Th1 lymphocytes in in vivo experiments increased more than 200% as compared to CD152 negative counterparts showing that indeed CD152 orchestrates specific migration of selected Th1 cells to sites of inflammation and antigenic challenge in vivo. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We show here, that CD152 signaling does not just silence cells, but selects individual ones for migration. This novel activity of CD152 adds to the already significant role of CD152 in controlling peripheral immune responses by allowing T cells to localize correctly during infection. It also suggests that interference with CD152 signaling provides a tool for altering the cellular composition at sites of inflammation and antigenic challenge

	19488034, oss of steroid receptor co-activator-3 attenuates carbon tetrachloride-induced murine hepatic injury and fibrosis.Hepatic fibrosis, a disease characterized by altered accumulation of extracellular matrix, can cause cirrhosis and liver failure. There is growing interest in the impact of co-activators on hepatic fibrogenesis. Here, we provided genetic evidence that mice lacking steroid receptor co-activator-3 (SRC-3) were protected against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced acute liver necrosis and chronic hepatic fibrosis. After acute CCl4 treatment, SRC-3(-/-) mice showed attenuated profibrotic response and hepatocyte apoptosis, whereas hepatocyte proliferation was elevated in SRC-3(-/-) mice versus SRC-3+/+ mice. Similarly, chronically CCl4-treated SRC-3(-/-) mice showed significant weakening of inflammatory infiltrates, hepatic stellate cell activation and collagen accumulation in the liver compared with SRC-3+/+ mice. Further investigation revealed that TGFbeta1/Smad signaling pathway was impaired in the absence of SRC-3. Moreover, the expression levels of SRC-3, as assessed in human tissue microarray of liver diseases, correlated positively with degrees of fibrosis. These data revealed that SRC-3(-/-) mice were resistant to CCl4-induced acute and chronic hepatic damage and TGFbeta1/Smad signaling was suppressed in the lack of SRC-3. Our results established an essential involvement of SRC-3 in liver fibrogenesis, which might provide new clues to the future treatment of hepatic fibrosis

	19491390, -cell antigen receptor signaling enhances chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell migration and survival: specific targeting with a novel spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor, R406.Antigenic stimulation through the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) is considered to promote the expansion of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells. The spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), a key component of BCR signaling, can be blocked by R406, a small-molecule Syk inhibitor, that displayed activity in CLL patients in a first clinical trial. In this study, we investigated the effects of BCR stimulation and R406 on CLL cell survival and migration. The prosurvival effects promoted by anti-IgM stimulation and nurselike cells were abrogated by R406. BCR triggering up-regulated adhesion molecules, and increased CLL cell migration toward the chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL13. BCR activation also enhanced CLL cell migration beneath marrow stromal cells. These responses were blocked by R406, which furthermore abrogated BCR-dependent secretion of T-cell chemokines (CCL3 and CCL4) by CLL cells. Finally, R406 inhibited constitutive and BCR-induced activation of Syk, extracellular signal-regulated kinases, and AKT, and blocked BCR-induced calcium mobilization. These findings suggest that BCR activation favors CLL cell homing, retention, and survival in tissue microenvironments. R406 effectively blocks these BCR-dependent responses in CLL cells, providing an explanation for the activity of R406 in patients with CLL

	19501992, herapeutic efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine 319 recipe on hepatic fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride in rats.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hepatic fibrosis is a consequence of severe liver damage that occurs in many patients with chronic liver diseases. TCM 319 recipe is a Chinese Medicine formula which consists of six Chinese herbs. In this study, we investigated the anti-fibrotic efficacy and mechanisms of TCM 319 recipe. METHODS: Hepatic fibrosis in rats was induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). 34 male adult SD rats were allocated into five groups (group 1-concomitant CCl4 and TCM 319 recipe for 8 weeks; group 2-CCl4 for 4 weeks and then CCl4 and TCM 319 recipe for 4 weeks; group 3-CCl4 alone for 8 weeks; group 4-TCM 319 recipe only for 8 weeks; group 5-untreated controls). After 8 weeks of treatment, serum ALT assay, liver tissue histological examination and immunostaining were carried out to examine the liver function and fibrosis degree. The expression levels of platelet derived growth factor (PDGF-B), PDGF-Rbeta, and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) were measured by quantitative RT-PCR and western blot. RESULTS: TCM 319 recipe reduced liver injury and attenuated hepatic fibrosis in group 1 compared with that in group 3. TCM 319 recipe suppressed the mRNA expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1). In addition, treatment with TCM 319 recipe significantly down-regulated mRNA expression of PDGF-B and PDGF-Rbeta, and it also suppressed protein expression of PDGF-Rbeta and TGF-beta1. CONCLUSIONS: TCM 319 recipe extracts could attenuate hepatic fibrosis induced by CCl4 in rats. The anti-fibrotic effect of TCM 319 recipe is associated with the down-regulation of mRNA expression of TIMP-1, PDGF-B and PDGF-Rbeta, and with the suppression of protein expression of PDGF-Rbeta and TGF-beta1

	19502658, harmacokinetics of acemetacin and its active metabolite indomethacin in rats during acute hepatic damage and liver regeneration.BACKGROUND AND AIM: The pharmacokinetics of acemetacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug which is biotransformed to indomethacin by hepatic first-pass effect, was examined during the necrotic and regeneration phases resulting from acute hepatitis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Acute hepatitis was induced by oral CCl4 administration to male Wistar rats. On days 0, 1 and 3 after the insult, liver histological analysis was performed, biochemical markers of liver damage and regeneration were measured, and the pharmacokinetics of oral acemetacin and of its active metabolite, indomethacin, were determined. RESULTS: One day after CCl4 administration, liver necrosis was apparent and there was an increase in the circulating levels of indicators of liver damage and regeneration with regard to control conditions. Acemetacin bioavailability was increased, although not in a statistically significant manner. On the other hand, indomethacin bioavailability was significantly reduced. By day 3, histological analysis revealed liver recovery, although not complete, while biochemical indicators of hepatic damage had reverted either totally or partially. Markers of liver regeneration were still increased. Bioavailability acemetacin and indomethacin was comparable to control values. IN CONCLUSION: Indomethacin bioavailability after oral administration of its precursor, acemetacin, is significantly reduced by acute hepatitis produced by CCl4. Pharmacokinetic alterations, as liver damage, are reversible, but do not require complete liver regeneration to return to basal conditions

	19527736, eleterious effects of silymarin on the expression of genes controlling endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity in carbon tetrachloride-treated rat livers.AIMS: Defects in intrahepatic nitric oxide (NO) are attributed to reduced blood flow due to portal hypertension caused by diminished endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity. The aim of this study is to identify the therapeutic effects of silymarin on eNOS/NO-related enzymes and hepatic enzymes in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced cirrhotic rats. MAIN METHODS: CCl4 treated for 12 weeks was discontinued and then administrated with silymarin daily for 4 weeks. Collagen concentrations were determined by measuring hydroxyproline content. Serum was assayed for hepatic enzymes like alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities. NOS activities were measured by oxyhemoglobin oxidation assay, and levels of enzyme expression and phosphorylation were detected by Western-blot analyses. KEY FINDINGS: Silymarin treatment restored the values for collagen content and ALT and ALP activities when compared to the values with spontaneous resolution following discontinuation of CCl4. CCl4 treatment highly increased eNOS expression and NOS activity in livers, but the phosphorylation was markedly decreased. Silymarin decreased significantly eNOS expression and activity. Expression and/or phosphorylation of enzymes activating eNOS were unchanged (Akt and AMPK) or decreased (PKA) by silymarin. Especially, the expression of caveolin-1, an inhibitor of eNOS was unchanged by CCl4, but its phosphorylation was significantly increased. However, silymarin markedly increased caveolin-1 expression but decreased its phosphorylation to expression. SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that chronic silymarin treatment can improve cirrhosis-induced liver enzyme activities and fibrosis, but may aggravate the hemodynamic eNOS activity, particularly by decreasing eNOS expression and increasing caveolin-1 expression

	19536921, epatoprotective effects of Coptidis rhizoma aqueous extract on carbon tetrachloride-induced acute liver hepatotoxicity in rats.AIM OF THE STUDY: Coptidis rhizoma (CR, Chinese name is Huanglian) has been used in treating infectious and inflammatory diseases for two thousand years in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Its related pharmacological basis for the therapeutics has been studied intensively, but CR can also be used for vomiting of  dampness-heat type or acid regurgitation  due to  liver-fire attacking stomach  in TCM, whose symptoms seem to link the hepatic and biliary disorders, yet details in the therapies of liver diseases and underlying mechanism(s) remain unclear. To clarify this ethnopharmacological relevance, hepatoprotective effect of Coptidis rhizoma aqueous extract (CRAE) and its possible mechanism were studied in rats intoxicated with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) in the present study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SPRAGUE-Dawley (SD) rats aged 7 weeks old were intraperitoneally injected with CCl4 at a dose of 1.0 ml/kg as a 50% olive oil solution. The rats were orally given the CRAE at doses of 400, 600, 800 mg/kg and 120 mg/kg berberine body weight (BW) after 6 h of CCl4 treatment. At 24 h after CCl4 injection, samples of blood and liver were collected and then biochemical parameters and histological studies were carried out. RESULTS: The results showed that CRAE and berberine inhibited significantly the activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). Observation on the hepatoprotective effect of berberine was consistent to that of CRAE. CONCLUSION: The study is the first time to demonstrate that CRAE has hepatoprotective effect on acute liver injuries induced by CCl4, and the results suggest that the effect of CRAE against CCl4-induced liver damage is related to antioxidant property

	19548444, Syndrome identification of CCl4 induced liver fibrosis model rats based on syndrome detecting from recipe used]OBJECTIVE: To further demonstrate the cognition upon the prominent effect of Yiguanjian and Xiayuxue Decoction on the CCI4 induced rat model of chronic liver fibrosis which have been verified in the previous studies. From the viewpoint of detecting TCM syndrome by recipe used, through this cognition the pathological features of the liver injury model manifesting a syndrome of  Gan-yin deficiency with blood stasis obstructing collaterals  were further explored. METHODS: Wistar rats were randomly divided into the normal group, the model group, and the three medicated groups. All rats, except those in the normal group, were made into chronic liver injury model by subcutaneously injecting CCI4 for 12 weeks. Medication for the three medicated groups began from the 9th week after modeling, with oral administering of Yiguanjian (YGJ, a recipe has been verified to be effective for liver injury and fibrosis), Liuwei Dihuang Decoction (LWDH, a recipe with effects similar to YGJ) and Yinchenhao Decoction (YCHD, a recipe functioned differently) respectively for four weeks. Rats were sacrificed at the end of the experiment, changes of hepatic function, liver pathology and hydroxyproline (Hyp) content in the liver tissue were detected, and contents of Afamin and mRNA expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) in the liver tissue were assayed as well with Real-time PCR. RESULTS: As compared with the normal group, the pathological figures of the chronic liver injury and fibrosis and hepatic function deterioration obviously appeared in the model rats, with the liver content of Hyp and alpha-SMA mRNA expression increased, and Afamin mRNA expression decreased significantly. In the YGJ treated group, the hepatic collagen hyperplasia and deteriorated hepatic function alleviated significantly after treatment, with content of Hyp significantly lowered, and mRNA expressions of alpha-SMA and Afamin restored to some extent (P &lt; 0.05); the same effects on mRNA expressions of alpha-SMA and Afamin were shown in the LWDH treated group, also a decreasing trend of Hyp content (0.05 &lt; P &lt; 0.1), and a significant decreasing of alanine transaminase (ALT) activity was found; while in the YCHD treated group these pharmacological effects mentioned above were not observed at all. CONCLUSION: The pharmacological effects of LWDH and YGJ were similar to some degree, which gives support to the cognition that the feature of chronic liver injury model rat induced by CCI4 is attributable to yin-deficiency sydrome

	19567170, ffect of oxymatrine on the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases signalling pathway in rats with CCl4 induced hepatic fibrosis.BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signalling pathway plays an important role in hepatic fibrosis. This study explored the antifibrotic effect of oxymatrine on tetrachloromethane induced liver fibrosis in rats and its modulation on the p38 MAPK signalling pathway. METHODS: One hundred and twenty healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to six groups: normal (n = 20), induced fibrosis (n = 20), colchicine (n = 20) and three treatment groups of oxymatrine (n = 20 x 3). We obesrved changes in deposition of collagen, hyaluronic acid (HA), laminin (LN), collagen type IV (CIV), procollagen III (PCIII) and hydroxyproline (Hyp), a-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and phosphor-p38 (pp38). RESULTS: The relative indicators of changes in histopathology, HA, LN, CIV, PCIII, Hyp, alpha-SMA and pp38 were raised significantly in the induced fibrosis group (P &lt; 0.01 vs normal group). The semiquantitative hepatic fibrosis staging scores of middle dose group and high dose group were decreased (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01 respectively vs the induced fibrosis group), as was the average area of collagen in rats' liver, the concentrations of serum HA, LN, CIV, PCIII and liver tissue homogenate Hyp. The gene expression of alpha-SMA mRNA was considerably decreased in the treated animals, as was the protein espression of pp38 protein. CONCLUSIONS: Oxymatrine is effective in reducing the production and deposition of collagen in the liver tissue of experimental rats in ways which relate to modulating the fibrogenic signal transduction via p38 MAPK signalling pathway

	19569334, eduction of polychlorinated ethanes and carbon tetrachloride by structural Fe(II) in smectites.Ferrous iron associated with clay minerals can be important for the reductive transformation of organic contaminants in anoxic soils and groundwaters. We investigated the reactivity of structural Fe(II) in ferruginous smectite for the reduction of a series of polychlorinated alkanes (hexa-, penta-, 1,1,1,2-and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)) in laboratory batch reactors. Evaluation of reaction kinetics, product distribution, and C-isotope fractionation suggest that polychlorinated ethanes containing three alpha-Cl atoms reacted via reductive beta-elimination to the corresponding ethenes while CCl4-reduction leads predominantly to the formation of chloroform. Reduction kinetics followed a typical biphasic behavior characteristic of the presence of two types of Fe(II) species exhibiting different reactivity in the octahedral sheet of smectites, and reaction rate constants were pH-independent. Dehydrochlorination reactions of chloroethanes containing at least one beta-H atom were found to compete with or even dominate over the reduction reaction with increasing suspension pH. Reference experiments in homogeneous solution and with non-reduced smectite performed in the pH range of 5.5-8.5 suggest that the HCl-elimination is not catalyzed at mineral surfaces. From the observed slow transformation of chloroalkanes, we hypothesize that structural Fe(II) in smectites will be important mainly as a reductant in the subsurface once iron(hydr)oxides have been reductively dissolved

	19595748, nduction of CYP1A1, 2B, 2E1 and 3A in rat liver by organochlorine pesticide dicofol.The present study has determined the ability of dicofol, an organochlorine pesticide, to induce cytochrome P450 using rats treated with 1, 10, and 25mg/kg dicofol intraperitoneally for 4 days. Treatments with 10 and 25mg/kg dicofol produced dose-related increases of cytochrome P450 and cytochrome b(5) contents and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase, pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase, aniline hydroxylase, and erythromycin N-demethylase activities in liver microsomes. The treatments also increased glutathione S-transferase and superoxide dismutase activities in liver cytosol. Dicofol at 1mg/kg produced a general trend towards increases of the aforementioned enzyme levels. The results of immunoblot analyses showed that 10 and 25mg/kg dicofol increased protein levels of CYP1A1, CYP2B, CYP2E1, and 3A in liver. RT-PCR data indicated that dicofol induced mRNA expression of liver CYP1A1, CYP2B, and CYP3A. Pretreatments of rats with 10 and 25mg/kg dicofol decreased phenobarbital-induced sleeping time by 34% and 39%, respectively. Dicofol pretreatment at 25mg/kg increased CCl4-induced serum alanine aminotransferase activity by 4.3-fold and aspartate aminotransferase activity by 4.1-fold. The present study demonstrates that dicofol has the ability to induce CYP1A1, CYP2B, CYP2E1, and CYP3A in the liver and increase phenobarbital metabolism and CCl4 toxicity in rats

	19620252, n arrestin-dependent multi-kinase signaling complex mediates MIP-1beta/CCL4 signaling and chemotaxis of primary human macrophages.MIP-1beta/CCL4 is a principal regulator of macrophage migration and signals through CCR5. Several protein kinases are linked to CCR5 in macrophages including the src kinase Lyn, PI3K, focal adhesion related kinase Pyk2, and members of the MAPK family, but whether and how these kinases regulate macrophage chemotaxis are not known. To define the role of these signaling molecules, we examined the functions and interactions of endogenous proteins in primary human macrophages. Using siRNA gene silencing and pharmacologic inhibition, we show that chemotaxis in response to CCR5 stimulation by MIP-1beta requires activation of Pyk2, PI3K p85, and Lyn, as well as MAPK ERK. MIP-1beta activation of CCR5 triggered translocation of Pyk2 and PI3K p85 from the cytoplasm to colocalize with Lyn at the plasma membrane with formation of a multimolecular complex. We show further that arrestins were recruited into the complex, and arrestin down-regulation impaired complex formation and macrophage chemotaxis toward MIP-1beta. Together, these results identify a novel mechanism of chemokine receptor regulation of chemotaxis and suggest that arrestins may serve as scaffolding proteins linking CCR5 to multiple downstream signaling molecules in a biologically important primary human cell type

	19634318, siatic acid derivatives protect primary cultures of rat hepatocytes against carbon tetrachloride-induced injury via the cellular antioxidant system.We attempted to elucidate the hepatoprotective mechanism of two asiatic acid (AS) derivatives, 3beta,23-dihydroxyurs-2-oxo-12-ene-28-oic acid (AS-10) and 3beta,23-dihydroxyurs-12-ene-28-oic acid (AS-14), which exhibited significant protective activity against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatotoxicity in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. Our findings showed that AS-10 and AS-14 preserved the level of glutathione and the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase. In addition, these compounds ameliorated lipid peroxidation, as demonstrated by a reduction in the production of malondialdehyde. Furthermore, AS-10 and AS-14 did not restore the reduced total GSH level by BSO, indicating that the hepatoprotective activities of these compounds may be involved, in part, by regulating GSH synthesis. From these results, we suggest that both AS-10 and AS-14 exerted their hepatoprotective activities against CCl4-induced injury by preserving the cellular antioxidative defense system

	19646978, -)-Epigallocatechin gallate prevents carbon tetrachloride-induced rat hepatic fibrosis by inhibiting the expression of the PDGFRbeta and IGF-1R.Hepatic fibrosis is a major complication of various chronic liver diseases. Activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) play a critical role in the development of liver fibrosis and the axis of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)/PDGF receptor (PDGFR), a member of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), is closely associated with the activation of HSC. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 receptor (IGF-1R), which also belongs to RTKs, interacts with the PDGF/PDGFR axis, thereby cooperatively promoting hepatic fibrosis. We herein examined the effects of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which inhibits the activation of several types of RTKs, on the development of rat liver fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Drinking water with 0.1% EGCG significantly decreased the serum levels of both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase raised by CCl4, thus indicating an improvement of liver injury. In CCl4-injected rats, EGCG markedly attenuated hepatic fibrosis and decreased the amount of hydroxyproline in the experimental liver. The expression of PDGFRbeta and IGF-1R mRNAs in the liver was significantly lowered by the treatment with EGCG. EGCG also decreased the expression of PDGFRbeta and alpha-smooth muscle actin proteins, thus indicating the inhibition of HSC activation. These findings suggest that EGCG can exert, at least in part, an anti-fibrotic effect on the liver by targeting PDGFRbeta and IGF-1R. EGCG might therefore be useful in both the prevention and treatment of hepatic fibrosis

	19659781, melioration of hepatic fibrosis via Padma Hepaten is associated with altered natural killer T lymphocytes.Hepatic fibrosis is the end-stage consequence of chronic liver disease, affecting many people worldwide. Unlike the anti-fibrotic effect of natural killer (NK) cells, CD8 and NK T subsets are considered as profibrogenic subsets. Padma Hepaten is a multi-compound herbal preparation derived from Tibetan medicine and has proven efficacy in some clinical trials and tests at the cellular level. In this study, we evaluate the immune efficacy of Padma Hepaten administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) and/or orally in a mice model of hepatic fibrosis. Hepatic fibrosis was induced by 6 weeks of biweekly i.p. carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) injections in male C57Bl6 mice. There were four groups, including naive mice, non-treated fibrotic mice and fibrotic mice treated by Padma Hepaten at weeks 5-6 of fibrosis induction either orally or by i.p. injections. Padma Hepaten was prepared at 10 mg/ml in saline and 250 microl (2.5 mg) were administered four times per week. After week 6, animals were killed. To isolate a Padma Hepaten-associated effect on lymphocytes, splenocytes were harvested from either naive or Padma Hepaten-treated non-fibrotic donors. Isolated splenocytes were therefore reconstituted into two groups of irradiated recipients. Recipients were then administered the same CCl4 regimen. Hepatic fibrosis was determined by sirius red staining of liver sections and by assessment of alpha smooth muscle actin expression compared with beta-actin (both by mRNA as well as the protein liver extract western blotting). Hepatic fibrosis and alanine aminotransferase serum levels were decreased significantly in both Padma Hepaten-treated groups compared with the non-treated fibrotic group. Padma Hepaten treatment was associated with attenuation of lymphocyte subsets in both treated groups. Using a chemiluminescence technique to assess total anti-oxidant capacities (TAC), it was found that both the plasmas and livers of mice treated by CCl4 had significantly higher TAC compared with controls. However, the levels of TAC in animals treated either by CCl4 alone or CCl4 with Padma Hepaten were similar. Adoptive transfer of Padma Hepaten-treated lymphocytes was associated with fibrosis amelioration compared with recipients with naive lymphocytes. CCl4 generates higher levels of anti-oxidant capacities, probably as a response to oxidative stress. Padma Hepaten administration attenuated hepatic fibrogenesis significantly, accompanied by attenuation of lymphocyte but not anti-oxidant capacities

	19662719, epatoprotective property of Thespesia populnea against carbon tetrachloride induced liver damage in rats.The present study was carried out to evaluate the possible hepatoprotective activities of the medicinal plant Thespesia populnea in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver injury in rats. The water suspension (500 mg/kg b.wt.) of leaf, flower and stem bark of T. populnea showed varying levels of protective action against CCl4-induced liver damage as evidenced from significant reduction in the activities of serum marker enzymes for liver damage (alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase), and bilirubin levels when compared with CCl4-intoxicated control rats. The stem bark suspension showed maximum hepatoprotection compared with leaf and flower. An ethanol extract of the stem bark was more active than n-hexane and water extracts, showing remarkable protection at a dose of 60 mg/kg b.wt. The hepatoprotective effect of this extract was almost comparable to that of silymarin (100 mg/kg), a reference herbal drug. Thus, the present study indicates that ethanol extract of T. populnea stem bark is promising for further studies leading to hepatoprotective drug development

	19664723, oxsackievirus B3 infection promotes generation of myeloid dendritic cells from bone marrow and accumulation in the myocardium.Myocarditis is associated with increased number of CD4+ T cells in the myocardium after coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection. Previous studies show that CD11c+ myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) loaded with myosin could induce myocarditis. This study aims to investigate the generation and accumulation of mDC in CVB3-induced myocarditis. The presence of mDC in myocardium was detected by immunohistochemisty. Bone marrow-derived mDC were generated from uninfected and CVB3-infected mice. The percentage of CD11c+ mDC on cultured cells and mean fluorescence index (MFI) of double positive cells (CD11c+CD40+, CD11c+CD80+) were measured by flow cytometry. The expression of chemokine receptors (CCR5, CCR7) on mDC and chemokines (CCL4, CCL19) in the myocardium was detected. The migration of mDC in response to CCL4 or CCL19 was measured by chemotaxis assay. Mature mDC were elevated in the myocardium from CVB3-infected mice. The percentage of mDC generated from CVB3-infected group was increased. The MFI of CD11c+CD40+ and CD11c+CD80+ was increased in CVB3-infected group. The mDC showed a down-regulation of CCR5 and unaffected CCR7 mRAN levels associated with elevated CCL4 and CCL19 in the myocardium in CVB3-infected group. Numbers of migrating bone marrow-derived mDC from CVB3-infected mice were increased in vitro. We conclude that CVB3 infection induced the greater generation of mDC from bone marrow and accumulation of mature mDC in myocardial tissues. This migration was associated with increased levels of both CCL4 and CCL19 in the heart tissue. These suggest that blocking the migration of mDC may provide a novel therapy for myocarditis

	19702175, ntioxidant and hepatoprotective activity of ethanolic and aqueous extracts of Amorphophallus campanulatus Roxb. tubers.In the present study, the hepatoprotective activity of ethanolic and aqueous extracts of Amorphophallus campanulatus (Roxb.) tubers were evaluated against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced hepatic damage in rats. The extracts at a dose of 500 mg/kg were administered orally once daily. The substantially elevated serum enzymatic levels were significantly restored towards normalization by the extracts. Silymarin was used as a standard reference and exhibited significant hepatoprotective activity against carbon tetrachloride induced haptotoxicity in rats. The biochemical observations were supplemented with histopathological examination of rat liver sections. The results of this study strongly indicate that Amorphophallus campanulatus (Roxb.) tubers have potent hepatoprotective action against carbon tetrachloride induced hepatic damage in rats. The ethanolic extract was found hepatoprotective more potent than the aqueous extract. The antioxidant activity was also screened and found positive for both ethanolic and aqueous extracts. This study suggests that possible mechanism of this activity may be due to free radical scavenging potential caused by the presence of flavonoids in the extracts

	19702178, itigation of carbon tetrachloride-induced damage by Phyllanthus amarus in liver of mice.Liver disease has become a global concern worldwide. In absence of reliable liver protective drugs in modem medicine, a large number of medicinal preparations are recommended for the treatment of liver disorders as they are believed to be harmless based on their natural origin. The aim of the present study was to determine the hepatoprotective activity of Phyllanthus amarus plant extract against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4-induced liver damage in female mice. Carbon tetrachloride administration caused a significant increase in liver and serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and acid phosphatase (ACP), while total protein content significantly decreased as compared to vehicle control. The effect was dose-dependent. Oral administration of aqueous extract of Phyllanthus amarus along with carbon tetrachloride caused significant mitigation of CCl4-induced changes

	19735274, nfluence of early gut microbiota on the maturation of childhood mucosal and systemic immune responses.INTRODUCTION: Among sensitized infants, those with high, as compared with low levels, of salivary secretory IgA (SIgA) are less likely to develop allergic symptoms. Also, early colonization with certain gut microbiota, e.g. Lactobacilli and Bifidobacterium species, might be associated with less allergy development. Although animal and in vitro studies emphasize the role of the commensal gut microbiota in the development of the immune system, the influence of the gut microbiota on immune development in infants is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether early colonization with certain gut microbiota species associates with mucosal and systemic immune responses i.e. salivary SIgA and the spontaneous Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 mRNA expression and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine/chemokine responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). METHODS: Fecal samples were collected at 1 week, 1 month and 2 months after birth from 64 Swedish infants, followed prospectively up to 5 years of age. Bacterial DNA was analysed with real-time PCR using primers binding to Clostridium difficile, four species of bifidobacteria, two lactobacilli groups and Bacteroides fragilis. Saliva was collected at age 6 and 12 months and at 2 and 5 years and SIgA was measured with ELISA. The PBMCs, collected 12 months after birth, were analysed for TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA expression with real-time PCR. Further, the PBMCs were stimulated with LPS, and cytokine/chemokine responses were measured with Luminex. RESULTS: The number of Bifidobacterium species in the early fecal samples correlated significantly with the total levels of salivary SIgA at 6 months. Early colonization with Bifidobacterium species, lactobacilli groups or C. difficile did not influence TLR2 and TLR4 expression in PBMCs. However, PBMCs from infants colonized early with high amounts of Bacteroides fragilis expressed lower levels of TLR4 mRNA spontaneously. Furthermore, LPS-induced production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, e.g. IL-6 and CCL4 (MIP-1 beta), was inversely correlated to the relative amounts of Bacteroides fragilis in the early fecal samples. CONCLUSION: Bifidobacterial diversity may enhance the maturation of the mucosal SIgA system and early intense colonization with Bacteroides fragilis might down-regulate LPS responsiveness in infancy

	19756695, lobal gene expression profiling reveals a key role of CD44 in hepatic oval-cell reaction after 2-AAF/CCl4 injury in rodents.Liver progenitors, so-called oval cells, proliferate remarkably from periportal areas after severe liver injury when hepatocyte regeneration is compromised. These cells invade far into the liver parenchyma. Molecular mechanisms underlying these behaviors of oval cells remain poorly understood. In this study, we treated rats with 2-acetylaminofluorene/carbon tetrachloride to induce hepatic oval cells. By expression microarray analysis, we investigated global gene expression profiles in liver tissue, with an emphasis on adhesion molecules, extracellular matrix proteins, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), growth factors/cytokines, and receptors that might contribute to the distinct behaviors of oval cells. Genes upregulated at least twofold were selected. We then performed immunostaining to verify the microarray results and identified expression of MMP-7 and CD44 in oval cells. Staining of cytokeratin (CK)-19, an oval-cell marker, was similar between oval cells located next to periportal areas and those located far within the parenchyma. In contrast, CD44 staining was more intense in the parenchyma than in periportal areas, suggesting a role of CD44 in oval-cell invasion. Moreover, newly differentiated CK-19+ hepatocytes within foci did not show CD44 staining, suggesting that CD44 is related to the undifferentiated oval-cell phenotype. We then investigated oval-cell reactivity in CD44-deficient mice fed an oval cell-inducing diet of 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine. Results showed significantly reduced oval-cell reactivity in CD44-deficient mice. Thus, oval cells express MMP-7 and CD44, and CD44 appears to play critical roles in the proliferation, invasion, and differentiation of hepatic oval cells in rodents

	19761043, ntioxidant and hepatoprotective activities of Ocimum basilicum Linn. and Trigonella foenum-graecum Linn. against H2O2 and CCL4 induced hepatotoxicity in goat liver.Significant hepatoprotective effects were obtained by ethanolic extract of leaves of O. basilicum and T. foenum-graecum against liver damage induced by H2O2 and CCl4 as evidenced by decreased levels of antioxidant enzymes (enzymatic and non enzymatic). The extract also showed significant anti lipid peroxidation effects in vitro, besides exhibiting significant activity in superoxide radical and nitric oxide radical scavenging, indicating their potent antioxidant effects

	19775072, epatoprotective effect of Carissa carandas Linn root extract against CCl4 and paracetamol induced hepatic oxidative stress.Oral pre-treatment with ethanolic extract of the roots of C. carandas (ERCC; 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg, po) showed significant hepatoprotective activity against CCl4 and paracetamol induced hepatotoxicity by decreasing the activities of serum marker enzymes, bilirubin and lipid peroxidation, and significant increase in the levels of uric acid, glutathione, super oxide dismutase, catalase and protein in a dose dependent manner, which was confirmed by the decrease in the total weight of the liver and histopathological examination. Data also showed that ERCC possessed strong antioxidant activity, which may probably lead to the promising hepatoprotective activities of C. carandas root extract. These findings therefore supported the traditional belief on hepatoprotective effect of the roots of C. carandas

	19822030, rotective effect of apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) on hepatic steatosis and damage induced by carbon tetrachloride in Wistar rats.The present study was planned to investigate the protective effect of 10 % and 20 % apricot-containing feed on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatic steatosis and damage. Adult male Wistar rats (n 42) were divided into six groups of seven each, as follows: control group; CCl4 group; CCl4+10 % apricot group; CCl4+20 % apricot group; 10 % apricot group; 20 % apricot group. All apricot groups were fed with 10 % or 20 % apricot-containing feed for 5 months. CCl4 injections were applied to the CCl4 groups at the dose of 1 mg/kg for 3 d at the end of 5 months. In the CCl4 group, vacuolated hepatocytes and hepatic necrosis were seen, especially in the centrilobular area. Hepatocytes showed an oedematous cytoplasmic matrix, large lipid globules and degenerated organelles. The area of liver injury was found significantly decreased with apricot feeding. Malondialdehyde and total glutathione levels and catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities were significantly changed in the CCl4 group and indicated increased oxidative stress. Apricot feeding decreased this oxidative stress and ameliorated histological damage. We concluded that apricot feeding had beneficial effects on CCl4-induced liver steatosis and damage probably due to its antioxidant nutrient (beta-carotene and vitamin) contents and high radical-scavenging capacity. Dietary intake of apricot can reduce the risk of liver steatosis and damage caused by free radicals

	19827016, xidative stress modulation by Rosmarinus officinalis in CCl4-induced liver cirrhosis.Rosmarinus officinalis (Lamiaceae) possesses antioxidant activity and hepatoprotective effects, and so may provide a possible therapeutic alternative for chronic liver disease. The effect produced by a methanolic extract of Rosmarinus officinalis on CCl(4)-induced liver cirrhosis in rats was investigated using both prevention and reversion models. Over the course of the development of cirrhosis, the increased enzymatic activities of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and alanine aminotransferase, and the rise in bilirubin levels caused by CCl(4) administration, were prevented by Rosmarinus officinalis co-administration. When the cirrhosis by oxidative stress was evaluated as an increase on liver lipoperoxidation, total lipid peroxides, nitric oxide in serum, and loss of erythrocyte plasma membrane stability, R. officinalis was shown to prevent such alterations. On cirrhotic animals treated with CCl(4), histological studies showed massive necrosis, periportal inflammation and fibrosis which were modified by R. officinalis. These benefits on experimental cirrhosis suggest a potential therapeutic use for R. officinalis as an alternative for liver cirrhosis

	19827746, rotective effect of Pleurotus cornucopiae mushroom extract on carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatotoxicity.Pleurotus cornucopiae (PC) mushrooms are found in the field and commonly known in Japan as Tamogidake mushrooms. The present study investigated the protective effects of an aqueous extract of PC on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatotoxicity and the possible mechanism involved in this protection including cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1. Wistar rats were pretreated with aqueous extracts of PC (0, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) orally for 8 days prior to the intraperitoneal administration of a single dose of CCl4 (0.5 ml/kg) or corn oil. Pretreatment with PC mushroom extract significantly prevented the increased serum enzyme activities of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases in a dose-dependent manner, and suppressed the expression of CYP2E1. PC mushroom extract also protected hepatocytes from the damage effects of CCl4 as remarked by histological and electromicroscopical findings. It was concluded that repeated daily doses of aqueous extracts of PC mushroom reduced the toxic effects exerted by CCl4 on the liver

	19841162, ROUNT is a common regulator of CCR2 and CCR5 signaling to control directional migration.FROUNT is a known CCR2-binding protein that facilitates monocyte/macrophage infiltration. Here we report that FROUNT also binds to the C-terminal region of CCR5 and enhances CCR5-mediated cellular chemotaxis. We show that FROUNT overexpression enhances the directionality of chemotaxis, while FROUNT suppression results in impaired responsiveness. Furthermore, we found an increase in consolidated pseudopodium formation in FROUNT-overexpressing cells (FNT cells) on uniform stimulation with CCL4 (MIP1-beta), a specific ligand of CCR5. In most FNT cells, one to two pseudopodia directed toward higher chemokine concentration were found, whereas most FNT-suppressed cells had multiple pseudopodia. The data indicate that FROUNT is involved in sensing and amplifying a shallow extracellular chemokine gradient that leads to a limited number of accurate pseudopodia directed toward the chemokine concentration. In addition to its separate roles in CCR2- and CCR5-mediated chemotaxis, FROUNT, as a common regulator of these receptors, possibly plays a crucial role in the recruitment of immune cells expressing these receptors

	19853952,  novel model of CCl4-induced cirrhosis with ascites in the mouse.BACKGROUND/AIMS: The current approaches to study the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of liver diseases often rely on the use of transgenic mice. However, experimental models of decompensated cirrhosis have not been clearly established in mice. Thus, we aimed to set an efficient and well-tolerated protocol to induce cirrhosis in mice able to progress up to the ascitic stage. METHODS: C57BL/6N mice received CCl(4) subcutaneously, intraperitoneally or by inhalation. In the latter group, gaseous CCl(4) was administered according to three different schedules: increasing exposure times, twice weekly (traditional protocol; TP), short inhalation cycles, twice or three times weekly. RESULTS: Portal hypertension, sodium retention, and ascites developed in all groups between 11 and 15 weeks. Mortality reached 70% in the TP group, but it was only 0-10% with all other protocols. All the inhalation groups had significantly more ascites at sacrifice than those receiving CCl(4) subcutaneously and intraperitoneally. Extensive abdominal adhesions and evidence of enhanced hepatic inflammation, as suggested by the increased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in liver tissue, were found in the intraperitoneal group, while large granulomas at the injection site and marked neutrophil infiltration of lungs developed in the subcutaneous group. No extra-hepatic damage could be detected in mice inhaling CCl(4). CONCLUSIONS: The use of short cycles of CCl(4) inhalation represents a novel, safe, and effective method to induce decompensated cirrhosis in mice. Intraperitoneal CCl(4) leads instead to abdominal adhesions precluding a correct evaluation of ascites, while subcutaneous CCl(4) causes an unwanted systemic inflammatory response

	19898927, hemokine expression patterns in the systemic and genital tract compartments are associated with HIV-1 infection in women from Benin.INTRODUCTION: Understanding the genital mucosal immunity and the factors involved in linking innate to adaptive immunity is crucial for the design of efficient preventive strategies against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1. METHODS: Levels of both genital mucosal and blood chemokines were compared between 58 HIV-1-uninfected and 50 HIV-1-infected female commercial sex workers (CSWs) as well as 53 HIV-1-uninfected non-CSW control women at low risk for exposure, recruited in Cotonou, Benin. RESULTS: HIV-1-infected CSWs had significantly higher blood and genital levels of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-3/CCL7) and monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG/CXCL9) compared with those in both the HIV-1-uninfected CSW and non-CSW groups. In the HIV-1-infected group, levels of MCP-3 and MIG were significantly higher in the genital mucosa than in the blood. However, the blood levels of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-1a/CCL3) and MIP-1b/CCL4 were higher in HIV-1-uninfected CSWs compared with those in the other groups. CONCLUSION: Increased production of chemokines in the genital tract may favour the recruitment of HIV-1 target cells causing a mucosal environment that promotes viral replication and dissemination, whereas higher expression of beta-chemokines at the systemic level is associated with protection from HIV-1 infection

	19899326, omparative effects of vitamin E and kolaviron (a biflavonoid from Garcinia kola) on carbon tetrachloride-induced renal oxidative damage in mice.It became evident in this study that carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), can induce renal oxidative damage. The hepatoprotective effects of vitamin E (Vit. E) and kolaviron (KV), a biflavonoid complex from the seeds of Garcinia kola are well documented. The present study was designed to investigate and compare the renal protective effects of Vit. E and KV in mice given CCl4 (1.2 g kg(-1)) intra-peritoneally thrice a week for two weeks. CCl4 caused a marked increase in serum and renal lipid peroxidation (LPO) by 106 and 225%, respectively. Treatment with KV at 100 and 200 mg kg(-1) and Vit. E at 100 mg kg(-1) significantly (p &lt; 0.05) decreased the CCl4-mediated increase in LPO. Furthermore, CCl4-intoxication decreased the levels of renal reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) by 44, 56 and 43%, respectively. Treatment with KV and Vit. E significantly (p &lt; 0.05) ameliorated the GSH and SOD levels. Specifically, KV at 100 and 200 mg kg(-1) increased GSH by 32 and 27% and SOD levels by 50 and 53%, respectively. Likewise, treatment with Vit. E increased GSH and SOD levels by 31 and 53%, respectively. Effects on markers of renal functions showed that CCl4-intoxication significantly (p &lt; 0.05) elevated serum urea and creatinine by 287 and 186%, respectively. While treatment with Vit. E decreased serum urea and creatinine by 60 and 55%, respectively, KV produced insignificant (p &gt; 0.05) effect on these parameters. This study found KV unable to protect against CCl4-induced renal damage but confirmed the potency of Vit. E to enhance recovery from renal oxidative damage

	19917679, CR5 ligands modulate CXCL12-induced chemotaxis, adhesion, and Akt phosphorylation of human cord blood CD34+ cells.CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 play an important role in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) migration from and retention within the bone marrow. HSPCs are very selective in their chemotactic response and undergo chemotaxis only in response to CXCL12. In addition to CXCR4, HSPCs express receptors for various other chemokines; however, the role of these receptors is not well understood. Freshly isolated CD34(+) cells (highly enriched for HSPCs) from cord blood (CB) express low levels of CCR5; however, if the cells were washed with acidic buffer before Ab staining to remove any ligand bound to CCR5, then nearly 80% of CD34(+) CB cells were found to express CCR5 on the cell surface. Although none of the CCR5 ligands investigated in this study (CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5) induced chemotaxis, at relatively high concentrations they transiently enhanced CXCL12-mediated chemotaxis of CD34(+) CB cells. In contrast, CXCL12-mediated adhesion of cells to VCAM-1-coated surfaces was reduced if CD34(+) CB cells were pretreated with these CCR5 ligands for 15 min. The effect of these chemokines on CXCL12-mediated responses was not at the level of CXCR4 expression, but on downstream signaling pathways elicited by CXCL12. Pretreatment with CCR5 chemokines enhanced CXCL12-mediated Akt phosphorylation, but down-modulated calcium flux in CD34(+) CB cells. Modulation of CXCL12-mediated responses of CD34(+) cells by CCR5 chemokines provides a possible mechanism that underlies movement of HSPCs during inflammation

	19927273, ffects of Athamanta turbith fruit essential oils on CCl4-induced hepatic failure in mice and their antioxidant properties.The effects of essential oils isolated from mature fruits of Athamanta turbith ssp. hungarica (Borbás) Tutin and A. turbith ssp. haynaldii (Borbás &amp; Uechtr.) Tutin (Umbelliferae) on some liver biochemical parameters in mice intoxicated with carbon tetrachloride were investigated. Pretreatment with both essential oils extenuated the effects caused by carbon tetrachloride. In order to investigate in vitro antioxidant properties of the oils, three methods were applied: scavenging of both 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and OH radicals, as well as a test of inhibition of Fe(2+)/ascorbic-induced lipid peroxidation. Investigated essential oils exhibited modest antioxidant capacity. Therefore, their influence on biochemical parameters in intoxicated animals might be linked to the inhibition of enzymes (cytochrome P450 2E1) involved in metabolic activation of halomethanes

	19928576, Effects of hypoxen on morphological and functional state of the liver under of exogenous intoxication conditions]The effects of hypoxen on the metabolic processes in the liver tissue have been investigated on experimental animals (rats) with model tetrachloromethane (CCl4) induced toxic liver damage. It is established that the drug decreases the activity of transaminases and lactate dehydrogenase, the total bilirubin level in the blood serum, and the rate of free-radical lipid oxidation in the liver. These effects of hypoxen can be considered as manifestations of the hepatoprotective activity. The efficiency of the drug under conditions of CCl4 intoxication was confirmed by the results of a histological examination

	19950531, ttenuation of carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatotoxicity by cow urine distillate in rats.OBJECTIVE: To study the carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatoprotective activity in cow urine. METHODS: Effect of cow urine distillate on liver function was studied in vivo in rats intoxicated with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Hepatotoxicity was induced by a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of CCl4 in olive oil (5 mL/kg i.p). Protective effect of cow urine distillate (in three dose levels) and standard drug Silymarin (100 mg/kg, p.o) on liver function were studied in intoxicated rats. Parameters in the study included liver function tests and histological observations. RESULTS: The cow urine distillate decreased the levels of SGOT, SGPT, ALP, GGT, and total bilirubin in a dose-dependent manner (P &lt; 0.05) as sylimarin. CONCLUSION: The observed protective effects of cow urine distillate on liver function might be due to the presence of antioxidants in cow urine

	19950858, Comparative morphofunctional analysis of rat hepatocyte cultures isolated from the normal and pathologically changed liver due to experimental toxic hepatitis]The goal of the study was to examine the state of primary hepatocytes of rats with toxic hepatitis induced by combination of CCl4 and ethanol. Fluorescent immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated that normal and pathologic hepatocytes in culture formed actin cytoskeleton, cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts. To investigate morphology and localization of mitochondria the hepatocytes were stained with Rhodamine 123. Glycogen and DNA contents in hepatocytes were determined by fluorescent cytophotometry during the lifetime of the culture. Cells were maintained for 5 days, and there were no changes in ploidy distribution observed. The mean ploidy was not changed too. Thus hepatocytes of different ploidy demonstrated similar survival rate. The glycogen content was 50% higher in experimental group compared to the control. The glycogen content decreased in control and cyrrotic hepatocytes after collagenase isolation. It has been found that the control hepatocytes accumulated glycogen within 3 days. On the contrary, the glycogen levels remained to be low in the pathologic hepatocytes

	19966836, ntifibrotic effects of ZK14, a novel nitric oxide-donating biphenyldicarboxylate derivative, on rat HSC-T6 cells and CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis.AIM: To study the pharmacologic effect of ZK(14), a novel nitric oxide-donating biphenyldicarboxylate (DDB) derivative, on HSC-T6 cells and on CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrosis. METHODS: Inhibition of HSC-T6 cell growth by ZK(14) was evaluated by MTT assay. The effect of ZK(14) on the percentage of HSC-T6 cells undergoing apoptosis was measured using Annexin-V/PI double-staining and TUNEL assay. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and caspase activities were tested. Hepatic fibrosis was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by intraperitoneal injection with 14% CCl(4). Rats with hepatic fibrosis were randomly divided into four groups: model control, ZK(14) (20 mg/kg), ZK(14) (10 mg/kg) and DDB (5 mg/kg). Levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hyaluronic acid (HA), type III collagen (PCIII), and nitric oxide (NO) were assessed, and liver samples were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. The NO level in cells treated with ZK(14) in vitro was also measured. RESULTS: The effect of ZK(14) on HSC-T6 cell apoptosis was concentration- and time-dependent, with up to 50% of cells becoming apoptotic when exposed to 100 mumol/L ZK(14) for 18 h. ZK(14) treatment resulted in mitochondrial membrane depolarization and activation of caspases 3 and 9. At a dose of 20 mg/kg, ZK(14) significantly decreased serum transaminase (AST, ALT) activities and fibrotic index (HA, PCIII) levels and significantly inhibited fibrogenesis. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that ZK(14), a novel NO-donating DDB derivative, promotes HSC-T6 apoptosis in vitro through a signaling mechanism involving mitochondria and caspase activation and it inhibits CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrosis in vivo. The results suggest that ZK(14) has potential therapeutic value in the treatment of hepatic fibrosis

	20046229, at-storing multilocular cells expressing CCR5 increase in the thymus with advancing age: potential role for CCR5 ligands on the differentiation and migration of preadipocytes.Age-associated thymic involution is characterized by decreased thymopoiesis, adipocyte deposition and changes in the expression of various thymic microenvironmental factors. In this work, we characterized the distribution of fat-storing cells within the aging thymus. We found an increase of unilocular adipocytes, ERTR7(+) and CCR5(+ )fat-storing multilocular cells in the thymic septa and parenchymal regions, thus suggesting that mesenchymal cells could be immigrating and differentiating in the aging thymus. We verified that the expression of CCR5 and its ligands, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5, were increased in the thymus with age. Hypothesizing that the increased expression of chemokines and the CCR5 receptor may play a role in adipocyte recruitment and/or differentiation within the aging thymus, we examined the potential role for CCR5 signaling on adipocyte physiology using 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cell line. Increased expression of the adipocyte differentiation markers, PPARgamma2 and aP2 in 3T3-L1 cells was observed under treatment with CCR5 ligands. Moreover, 3T3-L1 cells demonstrated an ability to migrate in vitro in response to CCR5 ligands. We believe that the increased presence of fat-storing cells expressing CCR5 within the aging thymus strongly suggests that these cells may be an active component of the thymic stromal cell compartment in the physiology of thymic aging. Moreover, we found that adipocyte differentiation appear to be influenced by the proinflammatory chemokines, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5

	20079350, ntifibrotic effects of chronic baicalein administration in a CCl4 liver fibrosis model in rats.Baicalein was a major bioactive flavonoid derived from Radix Scutellariae in Xiao-Chai-Hu-Tang which was commonly used to treat chronic hepatitis and liver fibrosis in China. The aim of this study was to assess whether chronic baicalein administration could prevent liver fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) in rats and investigate its possible protective mechanism. The antifibrotic effects of baicalein were assessed directly by hepatic histology and indirectly by measuring levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hepatic hyaluronic acid, laminin and procollagen type III (PCIII) in serum, as well as hydroxyproline and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in liver. In addition, we further investigated protein synthesis of platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) beta receptor which has been identified as attractive target for therapeutic intervention. CCl(4) treatment increased levels of AST, ALT, hyaluronic acid, laminin, and PCIII in serum, as well as hydroxyproline and MMPs in liver. Baicalein treatment (20, 40, or 80 mg/kg for 10 weeks) dose-dependently decreased levels of these markers. Baicalein also reduced inflammation, destruction of liver architecture, and collagen accumulation and significantly inhibited protein synthesis of PDGF-beta receptor. Together, our results suggest that chronic baicalein administration inhibits stellate cell activation and proliferation by the down-regulation of PDGF-beta receptor and prevents the development of CCl(4) induced liver fibrosis in rats

	20079818, omparative evaluation of the protective potentials of human paraoxonase 1 and 3 against CCl4-induced liver injury.We previously reported that electroporation mediated hPON1 or hPON3 gene delivery could protect against CCl(4)-induced liver injury. However, substantial evidence supported that the in vivo physiological functions of hPON1 and hPON3 were distinct. To compare the protective efficacies of hPON1 and hPON3 against liver injury, recombinant adenovirus AdPON1 and AdPON3, which were capable of expressing hPON1 and hPON3 respectively, were intravenously injected into mice before they were given CCl(4). Adenovirus mediated expression of hPON1 and hPON3 were demonstrated by elevated serum esterase activity, hepatic lactonase activity, and hPON1/hPON3 mRNA expression in liver. Serum transaminase assay, histological observation and TUNEL analysis revealed that the extent of liver injury and hepatocyte apoptosis in AdPON1 or AdPON3 treated mice was significantly ameliorated in comparison with control. Meanwhile, overexpression of hPON1 and hPON3 reduced the hepatic oxidative stress and strengthen the total antioxidant capabilities in liver through affecting the hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) and total antioxidant capability (T-AOC) levels, regardless of the exposure to CCl(4) or corn oil. Administration of AdPON1 or AdPON3 also suppressed inflammatory response by decreasing TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels in CCl(4) mice. In this study, hPON1 exhibited a slightly higher efficacy than hPON3 in alleviating liver injury, but the difference between them were not significant

	20112395, umor necrosis factor neutralization results in disseminated disease in acute and latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection with normal granuloma structure in a cynomolgus macaque model.OBJECTIVE: An increased risk of tuberculosis has been documented in humans treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)-neutralizing agents. In murine models, impaired signaling by TNF causes exacerbation of both acute and chronic infection associated with aberrant granuloma formation and maintenance. This study was undertaken to investigate immune modulation in the setting of TNF neutralization in primary and latent tuberculosis in a non-human primate model. METHODS: Cynomolgus macaques 4 years of age or older were infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and subjected to clinical, microbiologic, immunologic, and radiographic examinations. Monkeys were classified as having active or latent disease 6-8 months after infection, based on clinical criteria. Monkeys used in acute infection studies were randomized to receive either adalimumab (prior to and during infection) or no treatment. Monkeys with latent infection that were randomized to receive TNF-neutralizing agent were given either an inhibitor of soluble TNF, recombinant methionyl human soluble TNF receptor I (p55-TNFRI), or adalimumab. Control monkeys with latent infection were given no treatment or saline. Data from previously studied monkeys with active or latent disease were also used for comparison. RESULTS: Administration of TNF-neutralizing agents prior to M tuberculosis infection resulted in fulminant and disseminated disease by 8 weeks after infection. Neutralization of TNF in latently infected cynomolgus macaques caused reactivation in a majority of animals as determined by gross pathologic examination and bacterial burden. A spectrum of dissemination was noted, including extrapulmonary disease. Surprisingly, monkeys that developed primary and reactivation tuberculosis after TNF neutralization had similar granuloma structure and composition to that of control monkeys with active disease. TNF neutralization was associated with increased levels of interleukin-12, decreased levels of CCL4, increased chemokine receptor expression, and reduced mycobacteria-induced interferon-gamma production in blood but not in the affected mediastinal lymph nodes. Finally, the first signs of reactivation often occurred in thoracic lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: These findings have important clinical implications for determining the mechanism of TNF neutralization-related tuberculosis

	20113491, ltrasound imaging in an experimental model of fatty liver disease and cirrhosis in rats.BACKGROUND: Domestic dogs and cats are very well known to develop chronic hepatic diseases, including hepatic lipidosis and cirrhosis. Ultrasonographic examination is extensively used to detect them. However, there are still few reports on the use of the ultrasound B-mode scan in correlation with histological findings to evaluate diffuse hepatic changes in rodents, which represent the most important animal group used in experimental models of liver diseases. The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of ultrasound findings in the assessment of fatty liver disease and cirrhosis when compared to histological results in Wistar rats by following up a murine model of chronic hepatic disease. RESULTS: Forty Wistar rats (30 treated, 10 controls) were included. Liver injury was induced by dual exposure to CCl4 and ethanol for 4, 8 and 15 weeks. Liver echogenicity, its correlation to the right renal cortex echogenicity, measurement of portal vein diameter (PVD) and the presence of ascites were evaluated and compared to histological findings of hepatic steatosis and cirrhosis. Liver echogenicity correlated to hepatic steatosis when it was greater or equal to the right renal cortex echogenicity, with a sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 100%, positive and negative predictive values of 100% and 76.9% respectively, and accuracy of 92.5%. Findings of heterogeneous liver echogenicity and irregular surface correlated to liver cirrhosis with a sensitivity of 70.6%, specificity of 100%, positive and negative predictive values of 100% and 82.1% respectively, and accuracy of 87.5%. PVD was significantly increased in both steatotic and cirrhotic rats; however, the later had greater diameters. PVD cut-off point separating steatosis from cirrhosis was 2.1 mm (sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 90.5%). One third of cirrhotic rats presented with ascites. CONCLUSION: The use of ultrasound imaging in the follow-up of murine diffuse liver disease models is feasible and efficient, especially when the studied parameters are used in combination. The potential implication of this study is to provide a non-invasive method that allows follow-up studies of fatty liver disease and cirrhosis of individual rats for pre-clinical drug or cell based therapies

	20120966, Evaluation of antioxidant and hepatoprotective properties of strain Lactobacillus casei 114001 in carbon tetrachloride-induced liver toxicity model]Daily oral administration to rats of probiotic strain Lactobacillus casei 114001 (L.c.) at dose 2,8 x 10(10) cfu/rat during 8 days reduced oxidative stress and liver lesions, induced by a single intraperitoneal administration of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) at dose 0.5 ml/kg b.w. It was evidenced by several histopathological and biochemical markers, characteristic for CCl4 toroxicity. Membrane damage by toxin was reduced in rats, treated with L.c.: alanine aminotransferase activity in plasma and nonsedimentable activity of lysosomal enzymes in liver were significantly decreased. Treatment with L.c. resulted in partial recovery of activities of antioxidant enzymes and enzymes of xenobiotic metabolism and full recovery of antioxidant capacity of liver cytosol. High level of activity and expression of proteins heme oxygenase and Nrf2 were maintained

	20122671, imple and effective method for producing [11C]phosgene using an environmental CCl4 gas detection tube.INTRODUCTION: Carbon-11-labeled phosgene is an important labeling precursor for PET molecular probes. Despite the usefulness of [(11)C]phosgene, some difficulties, especially in the formation of [(11)C]phosgene process from [(11)C]CCl(4), hamper its use. The present article shows a simple preparation method for [(11)C]phosgene. METHOD: [(11)C]CCl(4) was obtained using the conventional method by passing a mixture of [(11)C]CH(4) and Cl(2) through a heated quartz tube. The [(11)C]CCl(4) was transformed to [(11)C]phosgene simply by passing through a pretreatment tube of a Kitagawa gas detection system for the working-environmental CCl(4) concentration measurement at room temperature with a flow rate of 50 ml/min. RESULT: This tube successfully transformed [(11)C]CCl(4) to [(11)C]phosgene at room temperature. [(11)C]Phosgene was obtained at nearly 80% radiochemical yield (EOB) in a short synthesis time with high reproducibility. CONCLUSION: A high yield and reliable [(11)C]phosgene production method using a gas detector tube system for working-environmental CCl(4) concentration measurement was developed

	20155282, triking LD50 variation associated with fluctuations of CYP2E1-positive cells in hepatic lobule during chronic CCl4 exposure in mice.Intraperitoneal injection of serially diluted carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) from 0.2 to 2.0 ml/kg produced an LD(50) value of 0.46 ml/kg in the normal mouse. Following repeated administration of 0.2 ml/kg CCl(4) twice a week for 1 and 3 months, the LD(50) values were over 2.0 and 0.72 ml/kg, respectively. A single administration of 0.2 ml/kg CCl(4) induced, within 24 h, apoptotic death of liver cells in the centrilobular zone 3 that were observed positive in cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1). However, after repeated exposure to 0.2 ml/kg twice a week for 1 month, cells in the centrilobular area were almost completely replaced with CYP2E1-negative cells. These cells were tolerant to CCl(4). After 3 months of exposure, a considerable number of CYP2E1-positive hepatocytes were observed throughout the periportal zone 1 and intermediate zone 2. Thus, fluctuations in CYP2E1-positive cells during chronic exposure to low doses of CCl(4) induced tolerance, which can be partially lost after prolonged CCl(4) exposure

	20164648, hotolysis of Br2 in CCl4 studied by time-resolved X-ray scattering.A time-resolved X-ray solution scattering study of bromine molecules in CCl(4) is presented as an example of how to track atomic motions in a simple chemical reaction. The structures of the photoproducts are tracked during the recombination process, geminate and non-geminate, from 100 ps to 10 micros after dissociation. The relaxation of hot Br(2)(*) molecules heats the solvent. At early times, from 0.1 to 10 ns, an adiabatic temperature rise is observed, which leads to a pressure gradient that forces the sample to expand. The expansion starts after about 10 ns with the laser beam sizes used here. When thermal artefacts are removed by suitable scaling of the transient solvent response, the excited-state solute structures can be obtained with high fidelity. The analysis shows that 30% of Br(2)(*) molecules recombine directly along the X potential, 60% are trapped in the A/A' state with a lifetime of 5.5 ns, and 10% recombine non-geminately via diffusive motion in about 25 ns. The Br-Br distance distribution in the A/A' state peaks at 3.0 A

	20184502, o contribution of umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells to capillarization and venularization of hepatic sinusoids accompanied by hepatic differentiation in carbon tetrachloride-induced mouse liver fibrosis.BACKGROUND AIMS: The acceleration of capillarization and venularization of hepatic sinusoids after cell therapy would not be beneficial to restoration after liver disease. The goal was to observe the effects of umbilical cord (UC)-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) on liver microcirculation and their therapeutic potential in liver fibrosis. METHODS: Human UC MSC labeled with or without CM-DIL were transplanted into NOD/SCID mice with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced chronic liver fibrosis models. Because of the high autofluorescence on the injured liver sections, we used immunohistochemistry, Western blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), but not immunofluorescence, in order to avoid false images under a confocal fluorescence microscope. RESULTS: Human-specific alpha-fetoprotein and albumin mRNA and proteins were detected in CCl4-treated mouse livers receiving human UC MSC transplants. We only observed the gene expression of human-specific endothelial-like cells markers CD31 and KDR by RT-PCR, but not protein expression by immunohistochemistry, in UC MSC-transplanted mouse livers. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in injured livers 4 weeks after UC MSC transplantation was higher than in normal livers. However, UC MSC injection did not increase significantly the vascular density labeled by CD31 and (vWF) in the injured livers of UC MSC-transplanted mice compared with non-transplanted mice after CCl4 treatment. In addition, liver function was partly improved after UC MSC transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Human UC MSC can differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells but do not accelerate the capillarization and venularization of hepatic sinusoids, finally leading to the partial improvement of liver function in mice with CCl4-mediated chronic liver fibrosis

	20299743, ncreasing early insulin secretion compensate adequately for hepatic insulin resistance in CCl4-induced cirrhosis rats.A number of recent publications have reported an increased frequency prevalence of glucose intolerance with hyperinsulinemia in liver cirrhosis. The aim of this work was to detect, in CCl(4)-induced liver cirrhosis rat, the presence and starting point of muscle and liver insulin resistance. Eighteen rats received intraperitoneal injection of 2 ml of soybean oil containing of CCl(4) twice a week for 20 weeks. We executed standard oral glucose tolerance and clamp study to evaluate systemic insulin resistance. Hepatic glucose uptake was much lower in CCl(4) group than that in control group, but peripheral glucose uptake was not decreased in this study. In contrast, early-phase insulin secretion was enhanced in CCl(4) rat using oral glucose load during clamp methods. These data suggested that increased early insulin secretion compensate adequately for hepatic insulin resistance in rats. However there was a report that peripheral glucose uptake was decreased in the case of human liver cirrhosis, which was formed in the course of time. In a chronic condition, this may be associated with reduced insulin content and developed systemic insulin resistance in liver cirrhosis. Then a long term observation study will be required to examine the presence of muscle insulin resistance in liver cirrhosis

	20387497, The approaches for making acute-on-chronic liver failure in rat]OBJECTIVE: To study the approaches for making acute-on-chronic hepatic failure model in rat. METHODS: SD rats were intraperitoneally injected with 50% CCl4 (Carbon tetrachloride) olive solution every three days for 6 or 10 weeks. Then they were divided into two groups randomly and injected with D-galactosamine (D-gal) at a dose of 2 g/kg, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at a dose of 100 pg/kg and D-gal at a dose of 0.5 g/kg BW respectively. The levels of serum ALT, AST and TBil were detected,and histopathological changes were observed to evaluate these two models. RESULTS: After injection of 50% CCl4 olive solution intraperitoneally for 6 weeks, liver fibrosis happened in SD rats, 10 weeks, cirrhosis happened. Pelleta necrosis and massive or submassive necrosis was seen administration of two reagents mentioned above. CONCLUSION: By injecting of 50% CCl4 olive solution intraperitoneally, acute-on-chronic liver failure model could be induced by D-gal, LPS/D-gal in rats

Modal class in fibroadenoma and fibroadenomatous formed by di- and tetraploid cells, in breast cancer-tetraploid and higher depending on histological structure of tumor. Ratio of aneuploidy is higher in invasive ductal carcinoma and scirrhus [correction of skir] in comparison with invasive lobular carcinoma and other carcinomas, that evidences higher aggressiveness of these tumors

	10849214, rocessing of frameshifted vasopressin precursors.Biosynthesis of the vasopressin (VP) prohormone in magnocellular neurones of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system comprises endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transit, sorting into the regulated secretory pathway and subsequent processing in the individual proteins VP, neurophysin and a glycoprotein. These processes are severely disrupted in the homozygous diabetes insipidus (di/di) Brattleboro rat, which expresses a mutant VP precursor due to a single nucleotide deletion in the neurophysin region of the VP gene resulting in VP deficiency. Previous studies have shown the presence of additional frameshift mutations in VP transcripts, in solitary magnocellular neurones of the di/di rat due to a GA dinucleotide deletion resulting in two different mutant VP precursors with partly restored reading frame. Frameshifted VP precursors are also expressed in several magnocellular neurones in wild-type rats. In this study, we determined if the +1 frameshifted precursors from di/di and wild-type rats can lead to biosynthesis of the hormone VP. Therefore, eukaryotic expression plasmids containing the frameshifted VP cDNAs were transiently expressed in peptidergic tumour cell lines, and cells were analysed by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography and specific radioimmunoassays, and by immunofluoresence. Neuro2A neuroblastoma cells expressing the +1 frameshifted precursors of di/di rats retained products in the cell body. Only precursor or insignificant quantities of neurophysin-immunoreactive products were detected. In contrast, in AtT20 cells, frameshifted VP precursors were at least partly processed to yield the VP peptide, indicating that they have access to the regulated secretory pathway. Comparison between the two cell lines showed a very slow ER transit of the wild-type prohormone combined with inefficient processing in Neuro2A cells. The results show that mutant precursors can reach the regulated secretory pathway if ER transport is sufficiently rapid as in the case of AtT20 cells. This suggests that the di/di rat may regain the capacity to biosynthesize authentic VP through these +1 frameshifted precursors in magnocellular neurones

	10923270, Effect of the di mutation (non-sugar diabetes) on properties of kidney proteins in rats]Renal proteins were studied in Brattleboro rats of the didi genotype and in Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats with normal alleles +2 of this loci. In animals of the +2 genotype maintained under conditions of water deprivation, the content of 120 kDa protein increased significantly in inner medulla of the kidney over 3 days. No changes in the amount of this protein were observed in rats of the didi genotype under the same conditions. We suggest that the congenital inability of didi mutants to synthesize vasopressin accounts for the distinctions observed in the reactions of rats with different genotypes

	11477339, esmopressin impairs microcirculation in donor pancreas and early graft function after experimental pancreas transplantation.BACKGROUND: Protective effects of desmopressin in brain dead organ donors oppose reports on a hypercoagulatory potential and an increased leukocyte-endothelial interaction (LEI) after application of the drug. The aim was to evaluate the effect of desmopressin on organ donor's pancreas and early graft function. METHODS: Donor microcirculation was evaluated via intra-vital microscopy (IVM) in 24 BR (di/di) rats with central diabetes insipidus, randomly assigned to groups I (control without desmopressin application), II (single i.v. application, no pretreatment) or group III (single i.v. desmopressin application, s.c. pretreatment for 3 days). Microcirculation in recipients was evaluated 1 hr and 6 hr after syngenic pancreas transplantation. Groups III and I served as organ donors. After IVM specimens were taken for histology and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Desmopressin in II vs. I led to temporarily (30') increased LEI (Sticker 274.3+/-87.7 vs. 76.5+/-31.1/mm2 endothelial surface; P&lt;0.01) and impaired microcirculation (MCEV 0.43+/-0.07 vs. 0.99+/-0.06 mm/s; P&lt;0.01). Repeated application reduced MCEV and increased LEI for up to 12 hr. Histology in I vs. III showed increased inflammation (n.s.), necrosis (P&lt;0.05) and vacuolization (P&lt;0.01). Immunohistochemistry revealed increased endothelial P-selectin 20' after application. 6 hr after reperfusion organs from III showed reduced MCEV and increased LEI (P&lt;0.01). CONCLUSION: Repeated application of desmopressin impairs graft microcirculation. Perfusion of the pancreas is significantly reduced at the beginning of organ tissue conservation as well as after reperfusion. These disturbances might partly be due to observed endothelial P-selectin expression. Application of desmopressin up to 12 hr prior to organ explantation may impact graft quality

	12187044, hromosomal aberrations in transitional cell carcinoma: its correlation with tumor behavior.OBJECTIVE: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to study numerical aberrations of chromosomes 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 15, 17, X and Y in interphase nuclei of 16 transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) cell lines of the urinary tract. The number of chromosomal signal copies was compared with the DNA ploidy and correlated with the cellular grading and original tumor staging. METHODS: The single-target FISH with the repetitive DNA probes for chromosomes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 17, X and Y were performed in 16 human TCC cell lines. For each test specimen, a minimum of 200 nuclei were analyzed. The number of fluorescent signals per nucleus was recorded. Tumor ploidy was analyzed using the DNA propidium iodide flow cytometric method. These results were correlated with tumor grade and stage. RESULTS: In two diploid TCC cell lines, on average 67% of detected chromosomes were di-(i)somic. In 14 aneuploid TCC cell lines, on average only 10% (0-44%) of detected chromosomes were di-(i)somic. Chromosome X was completely changed into polysomism in 16 TCC cell lines (native male:female ratio = 12:4) but was unrelated to tumor grade or stage. Chromosome Y was lost in 10 out of 12 (83%) TCC cell lines which originated from male patients but was unrelated to tumor grade or stage too. 31% of chromosomes 11 and 15 were disomic in 16 TCC cell lines, 38% of chromosome 3 was monosomic, and 81-88% (83 in average) of chromosomes 1, 7, 9, 17 were polysomic. Disomic chromosome 11 associated with lower grade TCC and disomic chromosome 15 associated with higher grade TCC were noted (p &lt; 0.01). Higher incidence of low stage tumors was observed in TCC cell lines with disomic chromosome 11 or chromosome 15 (p &lt; 0.01). There was no correlation in somatic status of chromosomes 1, 7, 9, 17 with tumor grade and stage. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study demonstrate that polysomism of chromosomes 1, 7, 9, 17 and X occurs in most of the TCC cells with aneuploidy. The stability of chromosomes 11 and 15 is closely related to tumor grade and stage. The role of chromosome Y loss and monosomism of chromosome 3 in oncogenic relevant of bladder cancer is still unclear

	12575454, Specificity of gene di (diabetes insipidus) expression in homologous inbred rat strains]The diabetes insipidus mutation is displayed in homozygotes in the form of diabetes insipidus with water consumption from 30 to 100% of body weight per day. We developed two inbred sublines of the di/di Brattleboro rats as well as the recombinant inbred subline by integrating genes of August rats into the di/di mutant genome. Changes in the genetic background proved to have no effect on the quantitative parameters of the diabetes insipidus. The intensity of the secondary immune response and the content of tropomyosin in the medulla of the rat kidney can serve as additional marker traits of the di/di genotype

	12624936, Phenotypic expression of the mutant gene diabetes insipidus in rats and criteria of genotyping by phenotype]The autosomal semidominant mutant gene di (diabetes insipidus) is manifested in homozygotes in the form of diabetes insipidus with water consumption from 25 to 100% of body weight per day. The heterozygotes di/+ drink water at a rate higher than 5% but lower than 25%. The level of water consumption in rats with +/+ genotype does not exceed 5% of body weight per day. Segregation analysis of F1 animals yielded by various crosses showed that genotyping of di/di homozygotes is absolutely reliable at 30% and higher level of the water consumption per day

	12641953, Quantitative study of the cellular nuclear DNA contents in odontogenic cysts and ameloblastoma]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the proliferative potential of the epithelial cells in odontogenic keratocyst, radicular cyst, dentigerous cyst and ameloblastoma. METHODS: DNA contents and ploidy of basal and spinous cells in keratocyst, radicular cyst, dentigerous cyst, and the peripheral column cells and central reticular cells in ameloblastoma were analysis respectively. RESULTS: The more and higher DNA contents and the proliferating ploidy of keratocyst and ameloblastoma than those of radicular cyst and dentigerous cyst indicate the active proliferating potential. The spinous cells showed more active proliferating growth than the basal cells of keratocyst. The higher DNA contents of radicular cyst are related to the stimulus of the inflammation. The dentigerous cysts have more di-ploidy cells without active growth potential. CONCLUSIONS: The active cell proliferating growth in keratocyst and ameloblastoma is probably the pathological basis of their local aggressive biological behavior

	12722640, Interaction of the diabetes insipidus locus alleles with the renal 120 kDa protein-encoding gene in rat development]Age-dependant dynamics of the kidney inner medullary 120-kDa protein content in vasopressin-deficient Brattleboro rats with di/di mutant genotype was studied in comparison with WAG rats with genotype and normal vasopressin expression. Age-dependant dynamics of vasopressin content in neurohypophysis of WAG rats was also examined. It was shown that 10-day-old WAG rats were unable to elevate the synthesis of the 120 kDa protein in respond to long-term dehydration, while this tendency was clearly observed in the 15-day-old rats and later in the development. In WAG rats the onset of this specific feature was time correlated with the development of the respond to hydration by the elevation of vasopressin synthesis and release from neurohypophysis into blood. In the di/di rats dehydration had no effect on the kidney 120-kDa protein synthesis in all ages examined. These results point to the interaction between the di alleles and the 120-kDa protein-encoding gene in the course of development

	15827757, NA content heterogeneity in neuroblastoma analyzed by means of image cytometry and its potential significance.The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and significance of the tumor DNA content heterogeneity in 33 previously untreated human neuroblastomas. We used image cytometry to selectively analyze neuroblasts by excluding karyorrhectic or stromal cells from cytometric measurements. DNA content heterogeneity with more than one clonal subpopulation on DNA histogram was found in 8 of 33 cases. Of these 8 cases, 4 showed MYCN amplification. Double labeling fluorescent in situ hybridization with probes for the centromeric region of chromosome 2 and MYCN gene was used to confirm the DNA content heterogeneity. DNA content heterogeneity was associated with poorer prognosis in this study (P&lt;0.05). There was a significant correlation between euploidy (di- and tetraploidy) and worse prognosis, but only when heterogeneous neuroblastomas with euploid cell population were assigned to euploid tumors (P=0.006). Our results may explain the conflicting data in the literature regarding ploidy and suggest that DNA content heterogeneity and the presence of a euploid population may predict worse prognosis in neuroblastoma patients

	16832620, ynogenic plant regeneration from unpollinated flower explants of Eragrostis tef (Zuccagni) Trotter.Tef [Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter] is the most important cereal in Ethiopia. In its wild relative E. mexicana, regeneration of six green plants resulted from culture of 121 non-pollinated immature pistils. In the allotetraploid crop species tef, however, only callus and root formation was obtained by this method. By contrast, immature spikelets and panicle segments of E. tef proved amenable to gynogenic plant regeneration. Upon step-wise optimization of the protocol, efficient plant formation was achieved in all three cultivars tested. In cv. DZ-01-196, culture of 1305 immature spikelets resulted in formation of 159 green plants. Flow cytometric analysis revealed (di)haploid, triploid, tetraploid and octoploid regenerants, from which the vast majority was tetraploid. Tef-breeding programs will likely benefit substantially from efficient generation of true-breeding plants

	17234837, evelopment and performances of a Japanese quail line homozygous for the diabetes insipidus (di) mutation.A strain of Japanese quail with the polyuria disorder (excessive urination) was developed from founders that regurgitated water spontaneously. A back-cross with a nonpolyuric quail line showed that the polyuric strain was fixed for an autosomal recessive mutation that also induced polydipsia (excessive drinking). Plasma levels and brain mRNA contents for avian Arg vasotocin were little affected by the mutation, but plasma avian Arg vasotocin was 13-fold higher and brain mRNA contents were significantly increased in both normal and mutant quail following a 24-h water deprivation. Affected and normal birds had similar performance traits (egg production and quality, feed intake, and gross carcass traits), but residual feed consumption was higher in polydipsic males. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that this strain was fixed for a mutation similar to the di gene described in the chicken and which induces nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. This new strain of Japanese quail might constitute a convenient model for the analysis of the underlying mechanisms of the disorder in birds and for comparative study with mammals

	17927955, ypothalamic galanin and plasma leptin and ghrelin in the maintenance of energy intake in the Brattleboro rat.Galanin, ghrelin, and leptin are three peptides involved in feeding regulation and more particularly in fat intake. The Brattleboro (di/di) rat is a genetic model of diabetes insipidus characterized by a preference for fat when it is in a food choice situation. Here, we measured hypothalamic galanin concentrations, plasma ghrelin and leptin and dietary preferences of adult di/di Brattleboro rats, di/+ and Long-Evans controls. The Brattleboro rats weighed significantly less than the di/+ rats (-18%; P&lt;0.001). The fat-to-carbohydrate intake ratio was significantly greater in Brattleboro rats than in di/+ (P&lt;0.02) when the rats could choose between a high-fat diet and a high-carbohydrate diet. Galanin concentrations were significantly lower in di/di rats than in di/+ rats in the paraventricular nucleus (-56%; P&lt;0.001), but not in the arcuate nucleus. Plasma leptin was significantly lower in the di/di rats than in the di/+ rats (3.49+/-0.20 vs. 6.94+/-0.49 ng/ml; P&lt;0.001). Plasma ghrelin concentrations were significantly lower in Long-Evans rats than in the di/di rats (-21%; P&lt; 0.01). Given that galanin mRNA is overexpressed in the paraventricular nucleus of Brattleboro rats, these data are consistent with increased release of the peptide. In the Brattleboro rat, this overactive galanin system and the variations of ghrelin and leptin maintain an orexigenic drive favoring a preferential intake of fat which provides the animal with enough energy for its metabolism

	18196464, xpressed sequence tag analysis and development of gene associated markers in a near-isogenic plant system of Eragrostis curvula.Eragrostis curvula (Schrad.) Nees is a forage grass native to the semiarid regions of Southern Africa, which reproduces mainly by pseudogamous diplosporous apomixis. A collection of ESTs was generated from four cDNA libraries, three of them obtained from panicles of near-isogenic lines with different ploidy levels and reproductive modes, and one obtained from 12 days-old plant leaves. A total of 12,295 high-quality ESTs were clustered and assembled, rendering 8,864 unigenes, including 1,490 contigs and 7,394 singletons, with a genome coverage of 22%. A total of 7,029 (79.11%) unigenes were functionally categorized by BLASTX analysis against sequences deposited in public databases, but only 37.80% could be classified according to Gene Ontology. Sequence comparison against the cereals genes indexes (GI) revealed 50% significant hits. A total of 254 EST-SSRs were detected from 219 singletons and 35 from contigs. Di- and tri- motifs were similarly represented with percentages of 38.95 and 40.16%, respectively. In addition, 190 SNPs and Indels were detected in 18 contigs generated from 3 to 4 libraries. The ESTs and the molecular markers obtained in this study will provide valuable resources for a wide range of applications including gene identification, genetic mapping, cultivar identification, analysis of genetic diversity, phenotype mapping and marker assisted selection

	18502321, europeptide Y in the arcuato-paraventricular pathway and diet selection in the vasopressin-deficient Brattleboro rat.Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is one of the most important brain peptides involved in feeding behavior. It influences both food choice and fluid homeostasis. The paraventricular and arcuate nuclei belong to the main pathway through which NPY stimulates carbohydrate intake. In this study, we measured NPY in various hypothalamic microdissected areas in Brattleboro di/di rats, a rat model of diabetes insipidus with specific dietary preferences. We confirmed that this rat is characterized by an increased fat intake (+10%; p&lt;0.001) and a decreased carbohydrate intake (-10%; p&lt;0.001) leading to a completely different dietary profile than that of di/+ controls. This profile was associated with a decrease in NPY in the paraventricular nucleus (-33%; p&lt;0.005) and in the ventromedial nucleus (-24%; p&lt;0.002). Intake of carbohydrate was negatively correlated with the gradient of NPY concentration between the arcuate and paraventricular nuclei. NPY could therefore contribute to the qualitative changes of feeding behavior in the Brattleboro rat through altered transport/release of the peptide and participate in the balance of neuropeptides that determines food choice in this strain of rat

	7769952, rief report: prognostic importance of cellular DNA content in T1-2 N0 laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas treated with radiotherapy.One hundred fifty-two unselected, consecutive patients with T1-2N0 laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma received radical radiation therapy at the Division of Radiotherapy, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, Aviano, Italy. Thirty-one (20.4%) of the patients showed disease recurrence or persistence (R/P) after radiotherapy. Flow-cytometric DNA ploidy measurements were performed in 72 cases; 20 had tumor R/P and 52 did not. Tumor R/P occurred more frequently (in 17 [85%] of 20 cases) in patients with diploid tumors. The hazard ratio of recurrence in diploid tumors as compared with aneuploid tumors, after inclusion of all the other significant prognostic factors in a Cox proportional hazards model, was 8.9 (P &lt; .01). Therefore DNA ploidy seems to be an important marker of tumor R/P in patients with T1-2N0 laryngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy

	9783366, The cytofluorimetric analysis of the nuclei in the regenerating rat liver in the late periods after x-ray irradiation]The flow cytofluorimetric method allowed to show that intact liver nucleus population of adult (6 months) rats consists of discrete ploidy classes (2c, 4c, 8c and 16c+), from which the diploid class was approximately a half of the total nuclei. Thirty days after the wholebody X-ray irradiation with a dose of 2 Gy, the percentage frequency of each nuclear class was statistically unchanged. However, the polyploidization level of the total nuclear population increased. Partial hepatectomy induces an entering into mitotic cycle (maximum S-phase; 22 h after operation) of the most of the hepatocyte nuclei in both irradiated and unirradiated animals. With that the relative number of nuclei in S-phase decreases in geometric progression according to increasing of ploidy class. In regenerating liver of irradiated rats in comparison with that of unirradiated ones, the greater part of nuclei enters into the mitotic cycle at the expense of di- and especially tetraploid nuclei

	9849422, 0 years' neuroblastoma screening in Europe: preliminary results of a clinical and biological review from the Study Group for Evaluation of Neuroblastoma Screening in Europe (SENSE).Between January 1986 and May 1996, 870,313 children were tested in European neuroblastoma (NB) screening programmes. Among these children, 82 cases of NB (age range 4-24 months, median 11 months) were detected by screening. 83% of the patients had localised NB and 17% were diagnosed with generalised NB (stage 4, 10%; stage 4s, 7%). Unfavourable biological markers (MYCN amplification, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) 1p36, DNA di/tetraploidy) were observed in 14% of 76 biologically examined cases. The median follow-up time of all the patients was 21.5 months (range 1-101 months). To date, 69 patients are in complete remission (CR) and 2 patients have died due to therapy (stage 4, 1 patient; stage 3, 1 patient with unfavourable markers). Apart from screened patients, 16 other patients with NB were found who had previously had a normal screening test, i.e. 'false negative' patients (age range 10-41 months, median 31.5 months). The median interval between screening and diagnosis was 24.5 months (range 6-35 months). 11 of the 'false negative' patients suffered from generalised NB (stage 4) and 5 had localised NB at diagnosis. Unfavourable biological markers were observed in 7/12 patients. 5 patients have died, 2 achieved partial remission and 9 CR. 9 of the 11 patients with unfavourable biological markers diagnosed due to NB screening are currently in CR. It is very likely that, among the patients without unfavourable biological markers, we detected tumours which may have regressed spontaneously. These children may have undergone 'unnecessary,' but unavoidable, diagnostic procedures and therapy. To reduce the number of 'false negative' patients, a later screening could be helpful and should be evaluated

	16617590, mpact of war on central nervous system tumors incidence--a 15-year retrospective study in Istria County, Croatia.The aim of study was to analyze epidemiological features of central nervous system (CNS) tumors diagnosed in Istria County, Croatia, with a particular emphasis on incidence dynamics during the wartime (1991-1995). The data were extracted from the medical records of patients with CNS tumors admitted to the Department of Neurology of Pula General Hospital in the period from the 1st January 1986 to the 31st December 2000, N = 364. For calculation of rates, we used data from the 2001 Croatian consensus http://www.dzs.hr/Eng/Census/census2001.htm. Data are presented as counts and incidence rates (IRs) per 100,000 persons-years in the case of annual rates. Annual incidence rates are shown as  raw  incidence rates and smoothed 5-year rolling average rates. The examined patient-related variables were: sex, age, occupation, premorbidity and comorbidity, with a particular emphasis on psychosomatic disorders and negative habits. The analyzed tumor-related variables included clinical manifestation, localization, and applied diagnostic and therapeutic methods. Primary tumors were separated from the metastatic, and the latter were analysed with respect to their site of origin. The lowest incidence of CNS tumors (10 patients) was reported in 1990, and the highest (42 patients) in 1993. The incidence dynamics of CNS tumors showed a rapidly progressive increase over the 1991-1995 period, followed by the return to average values. The access to a better and more readily available diagnostics may only partially explain this phenomenon. Therefore, we analyzed other factors that may have contributed towards the rapid increase in the number of CNS tumors, such as its coincidence with the war or psychotrauma. The results confirm the observational clinical hypothesis of an extreme increase in the number of CNS tumors during the period under consideration

	17600937, istribution of human papillomavirus types in different histological subtypes of cervical adenocarcinoma.Little information is available regarding distribution of HPV types in different histological subtypes of adenocarcinoma (AC). Thus, in this study we examined the frequency of high-risk (hr) HPV types in AC, adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and adenosquamous carcinoma (ADSQ). A total of 102 cases of primary cervical adenocarcinoma (26 AIS and 76 invasive AC) obtained from pathology files from 1995-2006 were histologically subtyped. Our results demonstrated that endocervical type occupied the major subtype of AC (22/66) followed by ADSQ (17/66) where as in the group of AIS endocervical type (12/23) was followed by intestinal type of AIS (7/23). Successful DNA extraction was obtained in 89 samples; 81 out of 89 (91.0%) tested positive for HPV DNA. The prevalence of HPV DNA in AIS, AC and ADSQ was 91.3% (21/23), 90.9% (60/66) and 94.1% (16/17), respectively. We found HPV 18 type to be the most predominant type in AIS (11/21) and AC (17/60) followed by HPVof undeternmined type in AIS (3/21) and HPV 16 in AC (9/60) as the sole viral type. HPV 18 was most frequently detected type in all histological subtypes of AIS and AC. We have detected HPV DNA in all 5 samples of clear cell carcinoma (CCC), although other studies have reported a highly variable prevalence of HPVDNA in CCC. The most prevalent HPV type in ADSQ was HPV-16 followed by HPV 33 as single type. The observed overall predominance of HPV 18 in AIS (chi(2) = 6.109, p&lt; or = 0.025) and AC (chi(2) = 8.927, p&lt; or =0.01) as well as of HPV 16 in ADSQ (chi(2) = 10.164, p &lt; or = 0.01) was statistically significant. Our data revealed statistically significant predominance of single hrHPV infections in AIS (16/21; chi(2) = 11.523, p &lt; 0.001) and AC (37/60; X2 = 6.533, p &lt; 0.025) whereas multiple hrHPV infections were more abundant in AC comparing to AIS (23/81and 5/81, respectively; chi(2) = 13.989, p&lt; or =0.001)

	20056565, ssociation of heart rate variability in taxi drivers with marked changes in particulate air pollution in Beijing in 2008.BACKGROUND: Heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of cardiac autonomic function, has been -associated with particulate matter (PM) air pollution, especially in older patients and those with cardio-vascular diseases. However, the effect of PM exposure on cardiac autonomic function in young, healthy adults has received less attention. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the relationship between exposure to traffic-related PM with an aerodynamic diameter &lt;or= 2.5 microm (PM2.5) and HRV in a highly exposed panel of taxi drivers. METHODS: Continuous measurements of personal exposure to PM2.5 and ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring were conducted on 11 young healthy taxi drivers for a 12-hr work shift during their work time (09002100 hr) before, during, and after the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. Mixed-effects regression models were used to estimate associations between PM2.5 exposure and percent changes in 5-min HRV indices after combining data from the three time periods and controlling for potentially confounding variables. RESULTS: Personal exposures of taxi drivers to PM2.5 changed markedly across the three time -periods. The standard deviation of normal-to-normal (SDNN) intervals decreased by 2.2% [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.8% to 0.6%] with an interquartile range (IQR; 69.5 microg/m3) increase in the 30-min PM2.5 moving average, whereas the low-frequency and high-frequency powers decreased by 4.2% (95% CI, 9.0% to 0.8%) and 6.2% (95% CI, 10.7% to 1.5%), respectively, in association with an IQR increase in the 2-hr PM2.5 moving average. CONCLUSIONS: Marked changes in traffic-related PM2.5 exposure were associated with altered cardiac autonomic function in young healthy adults

	20177338, actors influencing outcome after deceased heart beating donor kidney transplantation in the United Kingdom: an evidence base for a new national kidney allocation policy.BACKGROUND: Outcomes after deceased heart beating donor kidney transplantation are good, but survival rates vary according to a number of donor-, recipient-, and transplant-related factors. This comprehensive analysis of transplant outcomes was undertaken to inform development of a new Kidney Allocation Scheme. METHODS: A complete case analysis of the outcome of kidney-only transplants in the United Kingdom, 1995 to 2001, was undertaken using Cox regression modeling. Seven thousand three hundred eighty-five (77%) of the 9585 transplants reported to the UK Transplant Registry were primary transplants in adults. Regrafts and pediatric patients (age &lt;18 years) were analyzed separately. Transplant and patient survival over 5 years were investigated in addition to causes of prolonged cold ischemia time (CIT). RESULTS: A variety of factors significantly adversely influenced kidney transplant and patient outcome, including older donor age, older recipient age, waiting time to transplant over 2 years, diabetes, and earlier year of transplant. Human leukocyte antigen mismatch and CIT were significant in analyses of transplant but not in patient outcome, and an increased graft failure rate was also identified in adolescent patients. CIT was prolonged by long-distance kidney exchanges between centers (2 hr) and reallocation of kidneys for alternative patients (7 hr). CONCLUSION: This study identified a number of factors that influence transplant outcome after deceased heart beating donor kidney transplant in the United Kingdom. The findings suggest that the influences of human leukocyte antigen mismatch and CIT are most relevant in considering a revised kidney allocation scheme

	19487471, ffects of decreased calmodulin protein on the survival mechanisms of alveolar macrophages during Pneumocystis pneumonia.Pneumocystis infection causes increased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the subsequent apoptosis of alveolar macrophages (Amø). Assessments of key prosurvival molecules in Amø and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from infected rats and mice showed low levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and reduced activation of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI-3K). Ubiquitous calcium-sensing protein calmodulin protein and mRNA levels were also reduced in Amø during Pneumocystis pneumonia (Pcp). Calmodulin has been implicated in control of GM-CSF production and PI-3K activation in other immune cell types. Experiments to determine the control of GM-CSF and PI-3K by calmodulin in Amø showed that GM-CSF expression and PI-3K activation could not be induced when calmodulin was inhibited. Calmodulin inhibition also led to increased levels of ROS and apoptosis in cells exposed to bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from infected animals. Supplementation of Amø with exogenous calmodulin increased survival signaling via GM-CSF and PI-3K and reduced ROS and apoptosis. These data support the hypotheses that calmodulin levels at least partially control survival signaling in Amø and that restoration of GM-CSF or PI-3K signaling will improve host response to the organism

	12869214, onstruction of a cytomegalovirus-based amplicon: a vector with a unique transfer capacity.Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has a number of interesting properties that qualifies it as a vector for gene transfer. Especially appealing is the ability of the CMV genome to persist in hematopoietic progenitor cells and the packaging capacity of the viral capsid that accommodates a DNA genome of 230 kbp. In order to exploit the packaging capacity of the CMV capsid we investigated whether the principles of an amplicon vector can be applied to CMV. Amplicons are herpesviral vectors, which contain only the cis-active sequences required for replication and packaging of the vector genome. For construction of a CMV amplicon the sequences comprising the lytic origin of replication (orilyt) and the cleavage packaging recognition sites (pac) of human CMV were cloned onto a plasmid. A gene encoding the green fluorescent protein was used as a model transgene. The amplicon plasmid replicated in the presence of a CMV helper virus and was packaged into CMV particles, with replication and packaging being dependent on the presence of the orilyt and pac sequences. The packaged amplicon could be transferred to recipient cells and reisolated from the transduced cells. Analysis of the DNA isolated from CMV capsids revealed that the CMV amplicon was packaged as a concatemer with a size of approximately 210 kbp. The CMV amplicon vector has the potential to transfer therapeutic genes with a size of more than 200 kbp and thus provides a unique transfer capacity among viral vectors

	17348690, inetic and structural studies on interactions between heparin or heparan sulfate and proteins of the hedgehog signaling pathway.Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans (PGs) interact with a number of extracellular signaling proteins, thereby playing an essential role in the regulation of many physiological processes. These interactions are important for both normal signal transduction and regulation of the tissue distribution of signaling molecules. In this study, we use surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to study interactions of HS and structurally related heparin with proteins in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. SPR analysis shows that heparin binds with different affinities to active fragments of the proteins Hedgehog (Hh), Interference Hedgehog (Ihog), Cam-related/Down-regulated by Oncogenes (CDO), and Sonic Hedgehog (Shh). Solution competition studies show that the minimum size of a heparin oligosaccharide capable of interacting with Ihog is larger than a tetrasaccharide and for interacting with Shh is larger than an octasaccharide. In comparison with heparin, Ihog and Shh exhibited a lower affinity for HS than for heparin, and CDO and Hh exhibit negligible binding to HS. This study clearly demonstrates Shh and Ihog are heparin and HS binding proteins and that both molecules preferentially bind heparin or HS having a high level of sulfation

	12447951, andomized study comparing 4'-epi-doxorubicin (epirubicin) versus doxorubicin as a part of induction treatment in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Doxorubicin or daunorubicin are routinely used to induce remission in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Efficacy of epirubicin (an analog of doxorubicin), however, has not been adequately evaluated in ALL management. This randomized study was undertaken to compare the relative efficacy of epirubicin vs. doxorubicin as part of induction chemotherapy in adult ALL. Between January 1990 and June 1998, 79 previously untreated adult ALL patients (age 11-55 years, median 20 years) were randomized to receive either doxorubicin (Group A, n = 39) or epirubicin (Group B, n = 40) as a part of induction therapy. Vincristine and prednisolone were common in each group. The induction treatment was followed by identical consolidation and maintenance therapy. The two groups were compared as regards pretherapy clinical and laboratory parameters, dose intensity of therapy, therapeutic efficacy, myelotoxicity, and survival. Epirubicin was as effective as doxorubicin in terms of complete remission rate (80% vs. 78.3%; P = 0.87) and relapse rate (57.1% vs. 51.7%; P = 0.68). Five-year overall survival (30% vs. 30%, P = 0.98) and disease-free survival (40% vs. 39%, P = 0.92) at median follow-up of 68 months was also similar in the two groups. The incidence of Grade 4 myelotoxicity was comparable in the two groups. Patients 20 years of age or less had better CR rates (90% vs. 65%; P = 0.011) and median overall survival (39 vs. 11 months; P = 0.008) compared to those who were older. From this study epirubicin appears as effective as doxorubicin as part of induction therapy for adult ALL. However, the results need to be validated on the basis of immunophenotype and cytogenetic prognostic characterization

	12557709, Early effect of intra-arterial chemotherapy combined with degradable starch microspheres for malignant hepatic tumors]The hepatic artery-embolizing effect of degradable starch microspheres (DSM) was assessed by dynamic CT scanning soon after embolization in patients with malignant hepatic tumors. Using the Seldinger method, DSM with a mixture of contrast medium, MMC, ADM or Epi-ADM was manually injected. The subjects were 32 patients with metastatic carcinoma of the liver (62 treatments) and 15 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma(19 treatments) (47 patients received 81 treatments in all). Dynamic CT scanning was performed within 2 weeks of each embolization procedure, and the percent reduction in the area visualized (necrotic effect) was calculated to assess the efficacy of embolization. The necrotic effect of embolization was classified as CR, PR, NC, and PD after 9, 41, 10, and 2 treatments, respectively, in the patients with metastatic carcinoma of the liver and after 4, 6, 6, and 3 treatments, respectively, in the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Although there was no patient in whom the tumor showed 50% or more reduction, the contrast enhanced area showed 50% or more decrease in 60 out of 81 treatments. Therefore, blocking of blood flow seemed to contribute more to the response than enhancement of the efficacy of the anticancer agents. Adverse reactions were all transient and controllable. Based on our results, intra-arterial chemotherapy plus DSM embolization seems to be useful for treating malignant hepatic tumors

	12845646, nfluence of drug-induced apoptotic death on processing and presentation of tumor antigens by dendritic cells.Here we have studied the effects of apoptotic cell death induced by chemotherapic agents on tumor phagocytosis by dendritic cells (DC) and presentation of the relevant antigen to T lymphocytes. Annexin-V-FITC (Ann-V) and propidium iodide (PI) staining was used to assess early apoptotic (Ann-V(+)/PI(-)) vs. late apoptotic/secondary necrotic (Ann-V(+)/PI(+)) death after a 24 hr observation of untreated and drug-treated gastric carcinoma cells. After treatments, the HLA-A*0201(+) tumor cell line KATO III was exposed for 24 hr to allogeneic, HLA-related GM-CSF, IL-4-driven immature (i) DC. Tumor-loaded iDC were tested for IL-12 release in an ELISA assay, incubated with the DC-maturating factor TNF-alpha and used as stimulators for autologous T lymphocytes. Generation of antitumor T response against KATO cells was evaluated in an anti-MHC class I MAb-blocked Interferon-gamma ELISPOT assay. After treatment with Cis-platin (cis), all dying cells were in early apoptosis, whereas secondary necrosis was the prevalent death pattern observed after epirubicin (epi) and doxorubicin (doxo). Doxo and epi increased tumor expression of heat shock protein (hsp) 70 and uptake of tumor cell components by DC, whereas cis treatment had no effect on hsp70 and was associated with poor tumor uptake by DC. Significant upmodulation of IL-12 was observed by DC that had taken up the doxo- and epi-treated tumors (p&lt; 0.005 and p&lt; 0.01, respectively). Increased IFN-gamma release was also observed after stimulation of T lymphocytes with DC loaded with doxo- and epi-treated (p&lt; 0.02 and p&lt; 0.005, respectively) but not with cis-treated DC. These data show that the products of early apoptosis cannot efficiently cross-activate MHC class I-restricted anti-tumor lymphocytes even in the presence of DC maturating factors, whereas secondary necrosis is associated with robust T cell response

	15544604, onstant infusion of epinephrine, but not bolus treatment, improves haemodynamic recovery in anaphylactic shock in dogs.OBJECTIVE: Epinephrine (Epi) is the treatment of choice for reversing cardiovascular collapse in anaphylactic shock (AS). In this condition, most treatment guidelines have been anecdotally derived and no randomized clinical trials have been conducted. In the present study, we examined the time course of haemodynamic recovery in a canine model of AS when Epi was administered at the initiation of allergen challenge before fully developed shock had occurred. METHODS: Randomized, controlled, crossover studies were performed approximately 3-5 weeks apart in ragweed-sensitized dogs while the animals were ventilated and anaesthetized. Epi was administered by bolus intravenous (i.v.), subcutaneous (s.c.), intramuscular (i.m.) routes and by continuous i.v. infusion (CI). The findings obtained in the Epi treatment (T) studies were compared with those found in a no treatment (NT) study. In the bolus studies, Epi was administered at 0.01 mg/kg, while in the CI study, the dose of Epi was titrated to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 70% of preshock levels. MAP, cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), and pulmonary wedge pressure (Pwp) were determined over a 3 h period. RESULTS: In the CI study, haemodynamics (CO, MAP, and SV) were significantly higher than those measured in the NT study and the bolus studies over approximately the first hour of the study. In the CI study, the amount of Epi infused was significantly less than in the bolus studies. CONCLUSION: When administered at the initiation of allergen challenge, bolus treatment of Epi by i.m., i.v., or s.c. routes caused limited haemodynamic improvement in AS. In contrast, constant infusion of Epi at a lower total dose produced significant haemodynamic improvement. Within the limits of this anaesthetized canine model, the results suggest that CI should be the preferred route in the treatment of AS when this treatment option is available

	15547139, apping of genetic determinants of the sympathoneural response to stress.Activation of the sympathoadrenal system (SAS, comprising the sympathetic nervous system and the adrenal medulla) in response to stressful stimuli is an important defense mechanism as well as a contributor to several cardiovascular diseases. There is variability in the SAS response to stress, although the extent to which this is genetically regulated is unclear. Some rodent models, including the hereditary hypertriglyceridemic (hHTg) rat, are hyperresponsive to stress. We investigated whether quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that affect sympathoadrenal response to stress could be identified. Second filial generation rats (n = 189) derived from a cross of the hHTg rat and the Brown Norway rat had plasma norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (Epi) levels, indices of activation of the sympathoneural and adrenal medulla components, respectively, measured in the resting state and in response to an immobilization stress. Responses were assessed early (20 min) and late (120 min) after the application of the stress. A genome scan was conducted using 153 microsatellite markers. Two QTLs (maximum peak LOD scores of 4.17 and 3.52, respectively) influencing both the early and late plasma NE response to stress were found on chromosome 10. Together, the QTLs accounted for approximately 20% of the total variation in both the early and late NE responses in the F(2) rats. Interestingly, the QTLs had no effect on plasma Epi response to stress. These findings provide evidence for a genetic determination of the response of a specific component of the SAS response to stress. Genetically determined variation in sympathetic nervous system response to stress may contribute to cardiovascular diseases

	15553758, A case of Vp3 hepatocellular carcinoma with a good QOL after multidisciplinary treatments]A 74-year-old male was examined with abdominal CT scan because of general fatigue. Abdominal CT scan indicated enhanced tumors, 9x8 cm in size in subsegment 6/7 and 5 mm in size in subsegment 3. Tumor thrombus was observed in the right portal branch to the main portal vein. We diagnosed the patient with Vp3 hepatocellular carcinoma. A right hepatectomy with extraction of portal venous thrombus was performed. Unresectable tumor was treated with one shot arterial infusion (epi-ADM 40 mg) and TAE 3 times at an interval of three months. The side effect was only a fever and the QOL was good under the treatment. But a tumor in S1 had developed, and the patient died at about 12 months after the operation

	15585598, iffering physiological effects of epinephrine in type 1 diabetes and nondiabetic humans.Acute increases of the key counterregulatory hormone epinephrine can be modified by a number of physiological and pathological conditions in type 1 diabetic patients (T1DM). However, it is undecided whether the physiological effects of epinephrine are also reduced in T1DM. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether target organ (liver, muscle, adipose tissue, pancreas, cardiovascular) responses to epinephrine differ between healthy subjects and T1DM patients. Thirty-four age- and weight-matched T1DM (n = 17) and healthy subjects (n = 17) underwent two randomized, single-blind, 2-h hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies with (Epi) and without epinephrine infusion. Muscle biopsy was performed at the end of each study. Epinephrine levels during Epi were similar in all groups (4,039 +/- 384 pmol/l). Glucose (5.3 +/- 0.06 mmol/l) and insulin levels (462 +/- 18 pmol/l) were also similar in all groups during the glucose clamps. Glucagon responses to Epi were absent in T1DM and significantly reduced compared with healthy subjects. Endogenous glucose production during the final 30 min was significantly greater during Epi in healthy subjects compared with T1DM (8.4 +/- 1.3 vs. 4.4 +/- 0.6 micromol.kg(-1).min(-1), P = 0.041). Glucose uptake showed almost a twofold greater decrease with Epi in healthy subjects vs. T1DM (Delta31 +/- 2 vs. Delta17 +/- 2 nmol.kg(-1).min(-1), respectively, P = 0.026). Glycerol, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) all increased significantly more in T1DM compared with healthy subjects. Increases in systolic blood pressure were greater in healthy subjects, but reductions of diastolic blood pressure were greater in T1DM patients with Epi. Reduction of glycogen synthase was significantly greater during epinephrine infusion in T1DM vs. healthy subjects. In summary, despite equivalent epinephrine, insulin, and glucose levels, changes in glucose flux, glucagon, and cardiovascular responses were greater in healthy subjects compared with T1DM. However, T1DM patients had greater lipolytic responses (glycerol and NEFA) during Epi. Thus we conclude that there is a spectrum of significant in vivo physiological differences of epinephrine action at the liver, muscle, adipose tissue, pancreas, and cardiovascular system between T1DM and healthy subjects

	15650840, tability of the HER2 gene after primary chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer.We investigated whether alterations of the Her2 gene could be detected in breast cancer samples following primary chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer. The prospective study involved 23 patients with stage-II, -III or -IV breast cancer. All patients were treated with two to six cycles of fluorouracil-epirubicin and/or cyclophosphamid/epi-docetaxel. The Her2 protein and gene were assessed both on core needle biopsies prior to and on surgical specimens after completing chemotherapy using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) methods. Estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER/PR) were also determined on both samples using IHC. Her2 status was modified in eight patients using IHC (35%) and in three patients using FISH (13%). Changes in ER/PR expression were detected in seven patients (30%). Our data suggest that alterations of the Her2 gene can occur, although not usually after primary or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, changes in ER/PR status seem to be a more common event; thus, both can lead to different therapeutic options. Intratumoral heterogeneity as well as sampling variations can contribute to modification of the Her2 status after primary chemotherapy

	15681079, pinephrine is an enhancer of rat intestinal absorption.Some physiological substances, including acetylcholine and nitric oxide, are useful candidates for stimulation of intestinal absorption of drugs. In the present study, we elucidated the ability of epinephrine (Epi) to stimulate the intestinal absorption of drugs. We evaluated the ability of Epi to enhance absorption of macromolecules using dextran (Mw 4000 Da), which is poorly absorbed from the intestine, as a model compound in situ in a closed loop of the rat jejunum. Treatment of the jejunum with Epi resulted in significant increase in absorption of dextran in a dose-dependent fashion. The area under the curve (AUC) from 0 to 4 h in the Epi-treated jejunum was 13-fold higher than that in the vehicle-treated jejunum. The absorption-enhancing activity of Epi was 40-fold higher than that of caprate, a clinically used absorption-enhancer of drugs. In the experimental conditions used in this study, histological injury of the mucosa and perturbation of the mucosal membrane were not observed in the Epi-treated jejunum. Treatment with an antagonist of alpha-adrenergic receptors attenuated the stimulation of intestinal absorption by Epi, and treatment with an agonist of alpha-adrenergic receptors resulted in enhancement of intestinal absorption. While an antagonist of beta-adrenergic receptors enhanced the absorption-enhancing effect of Epi, an agonist of beta-adrenergic receptors stimulated intestinal absorption. These results indicate that stimulation of adrenergic receptors may be a novel strategy for intestinal absorption of drugs

	15848152, omparison of agonist-induced Ca2+ responses in rat submandibular acini and ducts.Changes in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) induced by agonists were simultaneously monitored in rat submandibular acini and ducts using a Ca(2+) imaging system. Substance P (SP) elicited marked increases in [Ca(2+)]i in acini but not in ducts. Carbachol (CCh) increased [Ca(2+)]i in both acini and ducts, but the maximal level was higher in acini than in ducts. In contrast, epinephrine (Epi) also induced an increase in [Ca(2+)]i in acini and ducts, but to a greater extent in ducts than in acini. Isoproterenol (ISO) caused a small but significant increase in [Ca(2+)]i in ducts but not acini. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis using total RNA extracted from highly purified acinar and ductal cells showed that substance P receptor mRNA was present in acini at higher levels than in ducts. In contrast, alpha(1a)-adrenoceptor mRNA was more strongly expressed in ducts than in acini. The muscarinic receptors (M(3) and M(5)) and beta-adrenoceptors (beta(1) and beta(2)) were expressed at equivalent levels in both cell types. These results confirm that acini and ducts exhibit significant differences in agonist-induced Ca(2+) responses. Furthermore, substance P- and epinephrine-induced Ca(2+) responses were consistent with receptor mRNA expression in acini and ducts, but carbachol- and isoproterenol-induced [Ca(2+)]i increases were not

	15915396, ardiovascular responses in patients with acute allergic reactions treated with parenteral epinephrine.The present study describes the cardiovascular responses to epinephrine (Epi) given into the arm, in adult patients with acute allergic reactions, and the differential responses to subcutaneous (SC) and intramuscular (IM) administration. Sixty-three adult patients were treated with Epi administered SC or IM after H1 and H2 receptor blockade. Heart rate and blood pressure (BP) were then measured for 20 minutes. Changes in heart rate and BP variables were analyzed. Pulse pressure and systolic BP showed increases with time. Diastolic BP also showed a modestly decreasing values over time. Heart rates did not change. Time-related changes between IM and SC Epi treatment were not observed. Sex influenced timed BP values and a significant sex by time effect was observed. In subset analysis, only male patients showed an overall time effect for BP variables, especially pulse pressure. In conclusion, adults with acute allergic syndromes treated with arm-injected Epi show a modest but definite increase in pulse pressure and systolic BP. This pattern is observed more in males. Heart rate and blood pressure differences between IM and SC arm-injected Epi treatments do not appear to be significant

	16005435, odulation of epirubicin cytotoxicity by tamoxifen in human breast cancer cell lines.The present study was designed to investigate the modulatory effect of the anti-estrogen, tamoxifen (Tam) on epirubicin (Epi) cytotoxicity in breast cancer cell lines; MCF-7 and NCI-adr. Using sulphorhodamine-B assay, NCI-adr cell line was found to be five-folds more resistant to the cytotoxic effect of Epi as compared to MCF-7 cell line. Pretreatment of cells with Tam was observed to enhance Epi cytotoxicity by 4.3- and 6.5-folds in MCF-7 and NCI-adr cells, respectively. Tam-Epi interaction was found to be additive in MCF-7 cells and synergistic in NCI-adr cells. Flowcytometric DNA ploidy analysis revealed that, Epi induced cell arrest at G2/M phase. Tam pretreatment enhanced the blocking activity of low dose of Epi in MCF-7 and induced nearly two-fold increase in the percentage of S phase in NCI-adr cells. Determination of cellular Epi level revealed that Tam induced a significant increase in intracellular Epi accumulation only in NCI-adr cells after 48 h. However, analysis of P-gp function revealed that Tam failed to modulate P-gp function in both cell lines. Also, assessment of topoisomerae IIalpha gene expression showed that neither Epi nor Tam managed to change its expression level. In conclusion, Tam potentiates Epi cytotoxicity in sensitive and resistant breast cancer cell lines. This potentiation can be explained by an enhancement of cell accumulation in S and G2/M phase, at which the cells are most sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of Epi as well as an increase in the intracellular level of Epi in resistant cell line

	16109560, Effect of preoperative lymphatic chemotherapy on Bcl-2 and Bax expression in axillary metastasis of breast cancer]OBJECTIVE: To observe the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins and cell apoptosis induced by preoperative lymphatic chemotherapy with epirubicin-activated carbon suspension (Epi-CH) in the cells of axillary metastatic lymph node of breast cancer and investigate the mechanism. METHODS: Sixty patients with breast cancer of stages II-III were randomly divided into two groups. Forty patients in Epi-CH group were injected with 10 mg Epi-CH in the tissue around the primary tumor or biopsy excision 72 h before operation. Twenty patients in the control group were injected with 10 mg epirubicin solution in the same region. The stained lymph nodes full of tumor cells in Epi-CH group and the non-stained nodes in the control group were selected for apoptotic detection by TUNEL method. The expression of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins were examined by SP immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The apoptotic index of the metastatic cancer cells in Epi-CH group was increased remarkably in comparison with that in the control group [(9.5+/-2.7) % vs (3.8+/-1.4) %, P&lt;0.01). Compared with the control group, the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins were up-regulated significantly in Epi-CH group (P&lt;0.05 and P&lt;0.01, respectively), resulting in decreased ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. CONCLUSION: Lymphatic chemotherapy can promote cell apotosis in axillary metastasis of breast cancer, which may result from decreased ratio of Bcl-2/Bax

	16210439, ardiovascular effects of epinephrine during rewarming from hypothermia in an intact animal model.Rewarming from accidental hypothermia is often complicated by  rewarming shock,  characterized by low cardiac output (CO) and a sudden fall in peripheral arterial pressure. In this study, we tested whether epinephrine (Epi) is able to prevent rewarming shock when given intravenously during rewarming from experimental hypothermia in doses tested to elevate CO and induce vasodilation, or lack of vasodilation, during normothermia. A rat model designed for circulatory studies during experimental hypothermia and rewarming was used. A total of six groups of animals were used: normothermic groups 1, 2, and 3 for dose-finding studies, and hypothermic groups 4, 5, and 6. At 20 and 24 degrees C during rewarming, group 4 (low-dose Epi) and group 5 (high-dose Epi) received bolus injections of 0.1 and 1.0 microg Epi, respectively. At 28 degrees C, Epi infusion was started in groups 4 and 5 with 0.125 and 1.25 microg/min, respectively. Group 6 served as saline control. After rewarming, both CO and stroke volume were restored in group 4, in contrast to groups 5 and 6, in which both CO and stroke volume remained significantly reduced (30%). Total peripheral resistance was significantly higher in group 5 during rewarming from 24 to 34 degrees C, compared with groups 4 and 6. This study shows that, in contrast to normothermic conditions, Epi infused during hypothermia induces vasoconstriction rather than vasodilation combined with lack of CO elevation. The apparent dissociation between myocardial and vascular responses to Epi at low temperatures may be related to hypothermia-induced myocardial failure and changes in temperature-dependent adrenoreceptor affinity

	16222052, orepinephrine- and epinephrine-deficient mice gain weight normally on a high-fat diet.OBJECTIVE: Signaling through adrenergic receptors (ARs) by norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (Epi) regulates weight gain when mice are fed a high-fat diet (HFD) by controlling diet-induced thermogenesis. Thus, one would predict that mice unable to make NE/Epi because of inactivation of the dopamine beta-hydroxylase gene (Dbh-null mice) would have a propensity to become obese. We characterized the response of Dbh-null and control mice to a HFD. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Dbh-null and control mice were fed an HFD or a regular diet (RD) for 2 months. Body weight, adiposity, muscle triglyceride levels, and adipocyte size were measured, as were circulating leptin, adiponectin, triglyceride, glucose, and insulin levels. A glucose tolerance test was also preformed. RESULTS: Dbh-null mice gain weight normally on an HFD and have the same adiposity. Their serum triglyceride and leptin levels are normal, but adipocytes are approximately 30% smaller than controls. Dbh-null mice maintain low blood glucose levels and glucose tolerance when exposed to the HFD in contrast to controls. DISCUSSION: Complete lack of NE/Epi does not predispose to obesity. Because mice lacking all three betaARs become obese on an HFD, an imbalance of signaling through alpha- and betaARs seems to be responsible for obesity. Surprisingly, Dbh-null mice maintain glucose tolerance

	16351809, Impact of preoperative lymphatic chemotherapy on relapse and metastasis of breast cancer and its mechanism]BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVE: Although it is reported that lymphatic chemotherapy could raise drug concentrations in local lymph nodes and prolong survival time of patients with gastrointestinal tumors, its effect on breast cancer has not been explored. This study was to explore the impact of lymphatic chemotherapy on relapse and metastasis of breast cancer, and to investigate the mechanism. METHODS: Sixty patients with breast cancer of stage II-III were randomized into 2 groups: 40 patients in Epi-CH (carbon activated absorbing epirubicin) group were injected with 10 mg of Epi-CH in the tissue around primary tumor 72 h before modified radical resection; 20 patients in control group were injected with 10 mg of aqueous epirubicin in the same region. The stained nodes full of tumor cells in Epi-CH group and non-stained nodes in control group were selected. The apoptotic index (AI) of cancer cells in metastatic axillary lymph node was calculated by TUNEL method; the expression of Fas/Fas-L proteins was examined by SP immunohistochemistry; the relapse and metastatic rate was compared. RESULTS: The AI of cancer cells in metastatic axillary lymph node was significantly higher in Epi-CH group than in control group [(9.5+/-2.7)% vs. (3.8+/-1.4)%, P&lt;0.01]. The expression of Fas protein was significantly higher in Epi-CH group than in control group (P&lt;0.05), but the expression of Fas-L protein had no difference between the 2 groups (P&gt;0.05). No chemotherapy-related local and whole body reaction occurred in both groups. The relapse and metastatic rate was significantly lower in Epi-CH group than in control group (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Preoperative Epi-CH lymphatic chemotherapy could suppress relapse and metastasis of breast cancer, which might through up-regulating expression of Fas protein and inducing apoptosis of axillary metastasis cells

	16497365, he association of serum leptin with the reduction of food intake and body weight during electroacupuncture in rats.Previous studies indicate that acupuncture or electroacupuncture (EA) treatment reduces body weight and food intake in rats by increasing the level of anoretic peptides and decreasing that of orexigenic peptides in the hypothalamus. Considering a well-established role of leptin as a major regulator for feeding behavior in the hypothalamus, we hypothesized that EA might exert its effect via increasing serum leptin levels. In this study, we tested our hypothesis by evaluating the effects of EA on food intake and body weight, as well as on serum leptin levels in rats. Rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: AL (fed ad libitum with no treatments), Holder (fed ad libitum with daily holder restraint) and EA (fed ad libitum with daily holder restraint and 100 Hz EA stimulation) groups. During the four-week experimental period, daily food intake and body weight were measured. At the end of the experiment, levels of serum leptin and corticosterone, and plasma epinephrine (Epi) and norepinephrine (NE) were determined. Here we demonstrate that EA treatment indeed led to reduction of food intake and body weight, and to an increase of serum leptin levels. The level of Epi, NE, and corticosterone increased in the Holder group, but such increase in the level of aforementioned stress hormones was not observed in the EA group. Overall, our results suggest that EA treatment reduces food intake and body weight in rats possibly through increasing leptin levels, and that this effect of EA is not due to the stress caused by the daily holder restraint

	16713504, thanol consumption increases rat stress hormones and adrenomedullary gene expression.Numerous reports document altered drinking behavior following acute stressors but few describe physiological responses to acute stress of chronic ethanol consuming subjects. We tested rats' responses to 120-min foot restraint immobilization (Immo) after 1 week of liquid diet containing 5% wt/vol ethanol (ethanol-fed). Controls consumed isocaloric liquid diet ad libitum (adlib-fed) or in amounts equal to that of ethanol-fed subjects on the previous day (pair-fed). Each rat was implanted with a tail artery cannula on day 7 to allow remote blood collection before and during Immo on day 8. Plasma epinephrine (Epi); norepinephrine (NE); corticosterone (Cort); prolactin (PRL); adrenomedullary gene expression of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), and phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase (PNMT); and TH protein levels were measured. Ethanol-fed rats had two to threefold higher basal plasma Epi and NE and tended to have increased Cort compared to adlib-fed or pair-fed rats. Immo increased Epi and NE in ethanol-fed rats more than twofold above those observed in controls, and also increased Cort more in ethanol-fed than in control rats. PRL was marginally affected. Ethanol potentiated the normal immobilization-induced increase in adrenomedullary TH, DBH, and PNMT messenger RNA (mRNA). TH protein increased only in ethanol-fed rats. Increased plasma catecholamine levels, adrenomedullary gene expression, and TH protein concentration in nonimmobilized ethanol-fed rats strongly suggest that ethanol consumption was itself a stressor, which potentiated the subsequent response to acute Immo. Moreover, the observed interaction of ethanol and stress on plasma catecholamine levels illustrates the importance of minimizing additional stressful stimuli when investigating ethanol's physiological effects

	16938592,  comparison of transoesophageal cardiac pacing and epinephrine for cardiopulmonary resuscitation.The use of cardiac pacing to deal with bradycardia is well established. There is debate as to the benefits during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This study was performed to compare the effects of transoesophageal cardiac pacing and high-dose epinephrine on the benefits of cardiopulmonary resuscitation after asphyxial cardiac arrest in rats. Thirty Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes were randomly selected to a saline group (Sal-gro, treated with normal saline 1 mL IV, n = 10), an epinephrine group (Epi-gro, treated with epinephrine 0.4 mg/kg IV, n = 10), or a pacing group (Pac-gro, treated with normal saline 1 mL IV combined with transoesophageal cardiac pacing, n = 10) in a blinded fashion during resuscitation after 10 minutes of asphyxial cardiac arrest. Manual chest compression was in all cases performed using the same methodology by the same personnel who was blinded to hemodynamic monitor tracings. The rate of restoration of spontaneous circulation was 1 (10%), 7 (70%), and 8 (80%) of 10 in Sal-gro, Epi-gro, and Pac-gro, respectively. The rate of ventilator withdrawal within 60 minutes after resuscitation in Pac-gro was higher than that of Epi-gro (8/8 vs 1/7, respectively; P = .001); the survival rate after 2 hours in Pac-gro was significantly higher than that in Epi-gro (7/8 vs 1/7, respectively; P = .01). The data demonstrate that both epinephrine and transoesophageal cardiac pacing are effective within 10 minutes of asphyxia in rats. It is worth noting that transoesophageal cardiac pacing produced a better outcome with respiration and longer survival time compared with epinephrine after restoration of spontaneous circulation

	16959907, nticipatory responses of catecholamines on muscle force production.Few data exist on the temporal relationship between catecholamines and muscle force production in vivo. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of preexercise arousal on sympathoadrenal neurohormones on muscular force expression during resistance exercise. Ten resistance-trained men completed two experimental conditions separated by 7 days: 1) acute heavy resistance exercise protocol (AHREP; 6 x 10 repetitions parallel squats, 80% 1 repetition maximum) and 2) control (Cont; rest). Peak force (F(peak)) was recorded during a maximal isometric squat preceding each set and mean force (F(mean)) was measured during each set. Serial venous blood samples were collected before the AHREP and immediately preceding each set. Blood collection times were matched during Cont. Preexercise epinephrine (Epi), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA) increased (P &lt;or= 0.05) above Cont by 270, 255, and 164%, respectively. During exercise, Epi, NE, and DA continued to increase by 512, 271, and 38%, respectively, above preexercise values. F(peak) and F(mean) decreased by approximately 20-25% over the course of the AHREP. Post hoc data analysis revealed that five subjects (F(maintainers)) showed no decline (P &gt;or= 0.05) in muscular performance (F(peak), F(mean)) during AHREP and that five subjects (F(reducers)) had significant reductions in F(peak) and F(mean). Integrated area under the curve for Epi, NE, and F(peak) were greater (P &lt; 0.02) for F(maintainers) than F(reducers). In conclusion, an anticipatory rise in catecholamines existed, which may be essential for optimal force production at the onset of exercise

	17085378, asoactive biomarkers and oxidative stress in healthy recently postmenopausal women treated with hormone replacement therapy.BACKGROUND: Despite biologically plausible mechanisms for cardiac protection from estrogen therapy, recent clinical trials have suggested possible cardiovascular risk rather than benefit. However, it has been speculated that cardioprotective benefits from hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may be more evident in the early postmenopausal period. We have previously reported early beneficial effects on biochemical markers of endothelial function in healthy women after short-term estradiol replacement therapy. In this study we aimed to evaluate the effect of long-term HRT on different vasoactive factors and oxidative stress in healthy recently postmenopausal women. METHODS: Fifteen women (age 50 +/- 1 years, time since menopause 1.6 +/- 0.1 years) were randomized to a sequential oral and transdermal estradiol regimen (2 mg oral micronized 17beta-estradiol/day or 1.5 mg 17beta-estradiol gel/day). Oral dydrogesterone (10 mg/day, 12 days/month) was then cyclically combined with either of the estrogen therapies for 1 year. Blood samples were collected at baseline and after 1, 2, 6 and 12 months of therapy to evaluate levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol, 6-keto PGF1alpha (prostacyclin metabolite), nitrite/nitrate, epinephrine, norepinephrine, 8-isoprostane (8-epi PGF2alpha) and lipid profile values. RESULTS: FSH levels decreased (p &lt; 0.001) while estradiol levels increased (p &lt; 0.001) during HRT. Levels of epinephrine (p &lt; 0.001), norepinephrine (p &lt; 0.01), mean blood pressure (p &lt; 0.01) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (p &lt; 0.01) decreased, and nitrite/nitrate levels increased (p &lt; 0.01) during HRT, which did not significantly affect 8-epi PGF2alpha levels. CONCLUSIONS: One-year HRT significantly reduced the levels of catecholamines, mean blood pressure and LDL cholesterol while it increased levels of nitrite/nitrate, indicating cardiovascular benefit in healthy recent postmenopausal women. Levels of 8-epi PGF2alpha did not change, suggesting no evident relationship between HRT and oxidative stress

	17218964, ffects of sympathetic stimulation during cooling on hypothermic as well as posthypothermic hemodynamic function.This experimental study was performed to explore hemodynamic effects of a moderate dose epinephrine (Epi) during hypothermia and to test the hypothesis whether sympathetic stimulation during cooling affects myocardial function following rewarming. Two groups of male Wistar rats (each, n=7) were cooled to 15 degrees C, maintained at this temperature for 1 h, and then rewarmed. Group 1 received 1 microg/min Epi, i.v., for 1 h during cooling to 28 degrees C, a dose known to elevate cardiac output (CO) by approximately 25% at 37 degrees C. Group 2 served a saline solution control. At 37 degrees C, Epi infusion elevated CO, left ventricular systolic pressure, maximum rate of left ventricle pressure rise, and mean arterial pressure. During cooling to 28 degrees C, these variables, with the exception of mean arterial pressure, decreased in parallel to those in the saline solution group. In contrast, in the Epi group, mean arterial pressure remained increased and total peripheral resistance was significantly elevated at 28 degrees C. Compared with corresponding prehypothermic values, most hemodynamic variables were lowered after 1 h at 15 degrees C in both groups (except for stroke volume). After rewarming, alterations in hemodynamic variables in the Epi-treated group were more prominent than in saline solution controls. Thus, before cooling, continuous Epi infusion predominantly stimulates myocardial mechanical function, materialized as elevation of CO, left ventricular systolic pressure, and maximum rate of left ventricle pressure rise. Cooling, on the other hand, apparently eradicates central hemodynamic effects of Epi and during stable hypothermia, elevation of peripheral vascular vasopressor effects seem to take over. In contrast to temperature-matched, non-Epi stimulated control rats, a significant depression of myocardial mechanical function occurs during rewarming following a moderate sympathetic stimulus during initial cooling

	17259127, Efficacy of activated charcoal-epirubicin suspension for treatment of breast cancer with axillary metastasis]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of activated charcoal-epirubicin suspension (Epi-CH) for treatment of breast cancer and clearance of axillary lymph node metastasis. METHODS: Sixty patients with breast cancer of stages II-III were randomized into Epi-CH group (n=40) receiving injection with 10 mg Epi-CH in the tissue around the primary tumor 72 h before modified radical resection and control group (n=20) with 10 mg of aqueous epirubicin injection in the same region. The dissected axillary lymph nodes and the staining lymph nodes were counted. The concentration of epirubicin in the lymph nodes was detected by high-performance liquid chorography, and the specimens of lymph nodes were observed microscopically. RESULTS: In comparison with the control group, Epi-CH injection allowed dissection of 4.04 more lymph nodes (P&lt;0.01) and resulted in the staining rate of the axillary lymph nodes of 86.9% (565/650). The proportion of the staining lymph nodes with diameter&gt;1.0 cm was significantly lower than that with diameter &lt;or=1.0 cm (96/131 vs 469/519, P&lt;0.01). The metastatic rate of stained lymph nodes was similar with that in non-stained lymph nodes (214/565 vs 23/85, P&gt;0.05). In Epi-CH group, the concentration of epirubicin in the stained lymph nodes was significantly higher than that in non-stained ones (443.0-/+123.1 vs 31.8-/+11.9 ng/g, P&lt;0.01). Remarkable degeneration and necrosis could be observed microscopically in the stained lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: Epi-CH allows more effective treatment of breast cancer and clearance of axiliary metastasis by increasing the dissected lymph nodes and raising the concentration of epirubicin in the axillary lymph nodes

	17313283, tress hormones, effort sense, and perceptions of stress during incremental exercise: an exploratory investigation.Exercise elicits intensity-dependent increases in epinephrine (Epi), norepinephrine (NE), cortisol (CORT), and lactate (Lac), whereas at rest the hormonal responses to mental stress include increases in Epi, NE, and CORT, but not Lac. Additionally, elevations in CORT at rest are associated with negative affect. Finally, as exercise intensity increases, perceptions of effort (RPE) increase and affect becomes more negative. The purpose of this study was to examine the responses of Epi, NE, CORT, Lac, RPE, and affect during incremental increases in exercise to maximum. Seven highly-trained male runners completed a discontinuous treadmill protocol that included 10 minutes at 60%, 10 minutes at 75%, 5 minutes at 90%, and 2 minutes at 100% of VO2max. Blood samples were collected through an intravenous catheter before, during, and following exercise during the experimental condition, and during a time-matched control condition. RPE and affect were assessed just prior to each blood draw. The Epi, NE, CORT, and Lac displayed the expected incremental increases, however affect became more negative at higher exercise intensities, and RPE increased as exercise intensity increased. Data suggest that CORT follows the same pattern of response to graded exercise as affect. Since perceptual and affective responses to exercise are associated with motivation, these documented negative affective shifts during exercise should be considered in order to develop strategies that lead to enhanced exercise adherence and performance

	17336981, haracterisation of the sympathetic nervous system of Asian (Elephas maximus) and African (Loxodonta africana) elephants based on urinary catecholamine analyses.Assessing the welfare status of captive animals using non-invasive measurements of hormones is of growing interest because this can serve as an effective tool to facilitate the optimization of environmental and husbandry conditions. Both the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) exhibit extremely low breeding success in captivity, and because elevated levels of stress may negatively influence reproductive functions, this study sought to establish a method for assessing sympathoadrenal activity in captive female elephants. We found a circadian variation in urinary noradrenaline (norepinephrine, NE), adrenaline (epinephrine, Epi) and dopamine (DA) under short day length. Peak activity of noradrenaline and dopamine was noted at 3 a.m. Adrenaline showed a biphasic pattern with a minor peak recorded at 3 a.m. and a major peak 9 a.m. Under long-day photoperiodic conditions, simultaneous peaks of noradrenaline and adrenaline were again noted at 3 a.m. whereas dopamine does not appear to have a distinct circadian pattern under long-day length. A transfer of two elephant cows resulted in a marked increase in urinary adrenaline and noradrenaline levels, confirming that the transfer represented a stressful event. During the peripartal period, noradrenaline concentrations increased and maximum concentrations were obtained at delivery. Daily measurements of urinary dopamine throughout the follicular phase revealed an increase in dopamine secretion close to ovulation. This increase might indicate a role of dopamine in the ovulatory mechanisms. These results suggest that changes in urinary catecholamine excretion reflect fluctuations in sympathoadrenal activity and may be a useful indicator of stress

	17505516, pirubicin-vinorelbine vs FEC100 for node-positive, early breast cancer: French Adjuvant Study Group 09 trial.The aim of the study was to compare our reference adjuvant chemotherapy, FEC100 (fluorouracil 500 mg m(-2), epirubicin 100 mg m(-2) and cyclophosphamide 500 mg m(-2), six cycles every 21 days), to an epirubicin-vinorelbine (Epi-Vnr) combination for early, poor-prognosis breast cancer patients. Patients (482) were randomised to receive FEC100, or Epi-Vnr (epirubicin 50 mg m(-2) day 1 and vinorelbine 25 mg m(-2), days 1 and 8, six cycles every 21 days). The 7-year disease-free survival rates were 59.4 and 58.8%, respectively (P=0.47). The relative dose intensity of planned epirubicin doses was 89.1% with FEC100 and 88.9% with Epi-Vnr. There were significantly more grades 3-4 neutropenia (P=0.009) with Epi-Vnr, and significantly more nausea-vomiting (P&lt;0.0001), stomatitis (P=0.0007) and alopecia (P&lt;0.0001) with FEC100. No cases of congestive heart failure were reported, whereas four decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction occurred after FEC100 and five after Epi-Vnr. One case of acute myeloblastic leukaemia was registered in the FEC100 arm. After 7 years of follow-up, there was no difference between treatment arms. Epi-Vnr regimen provided a good efficacy in such poor-prognosis breast cancer patients, and could be an alternative to FEC100, taking into account respective safety profiles of both regimens

	17586459, ulti-photon microscopic imaging of rat parotid ducts demonstrates cellular heterogeneity in Ca2+ responsiveness.The heterogeneity of salivary ductal cells, with regard to their sensitivity to Ca(2+)-mobilizing agonists, was visualized by multi-photon microscopy. Stimulation of isolated parotid ducts with 0.1 and 1 microM epinephrine (Epi) elevated the intracellular Ca(2+) levels ([Ca(2+)](i)) in approximately 30% and &gt;90% of the ductal cells, respectively. Of the 0.1 microM Epi-responsive cells, 80% responded rapidly to subsequent stimulation with 1 microM Epi. Similarly, threshold concentrations (0.5 or 1 microM) of phenylephrine (PhL), carbachol (CCh) or ATP, induced responses in approximately 20% of the ductal cells, and subsequent stimulations with 10 microM of the same agonist activated approximately 80% of ductal cells. These observations indicate that parotid ducts contain a certain subpopulation of cells, which exhibits particularly high sensitivity to these Ca(2+)-mobilizing agonists, compared to the remaining ductal cells. Sequential stimulation with threshold concentrations of PhL, CCh, and ATP induced Ca(2+) responses in approximately 33% of ductal cells. Of these responsive cells, the majority (69%) could only respond to one of the three agonists; while a small minority (9%) were capable of responding to all three agonists. These results indicate that low concentrations of PhL, CCh, and ATP activate different subpopulations of parotid ductal cells

	17617081, valuation of platelet function and lack of response to epinephrine in pregnant women.Previous studies in healthy subjects have demonstrated a lack of response of platelets to epinephrine at a rate of 16-40% on an aggregometer. An association between the increased procoagulant factors during pregnancy and venous thromboembolism is known, and it has also been shown that prolactin levels increase platelet aggregation. We evaluated whether platelet functions in pregnant women and also assessed the lack of response to epinephrine during this period. We compared 27 healthy and volunteering pregnant women with 26 similar control subjects. Platelet functions were assessed with an aggregometer and a Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA-100). Less than 40% response to epinephrine on the aggregometer was defined as an impaired epinephrine response. The aggregation response of epinephrine was normal in 25 of the 27 pregnant women, while two of them showed a late-rising response. Eight of the 26 subject control group (30.8%) showed an impaired response to epinephrine. When we compared the 25 pregnant and 18 control subjects with normal aggregation responses, the maximum aggregation responses to ADP and epinephrine, and the Col/Epi and Col/ADP cartridge closure time values were significantly lower in pregnant women. There were no difference between second and third trimesters as regards platelet function parameters. The fact that no impaired response to epinephrine was detected in pregnant women while a 30% rate was observed in non-pregnant women indicates that the platelet malfunction caused by a disorder in the Gi protein and intracellular mechanisms is bypassed during pregnancy thanks to some physiological changes

	17917708, ffect of high dose statin therapy on platelet function; statins reduce aspirin-resistant platelet aggregation in patients with coronary heart disease.BACKGROUND: Current evidence supports the preventive role of statins on platelet aggregation in patients with coronary heart disease. AIM: Our aim was to determine the effects of aggressive statin therapy on platelet function in patients with coronary heart disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 178 consecutive patients (37-68 years old, 35.9% women) with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) was enrolled in the study. Platelet function assays were realized by the Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA)-100 with collagen and epinephrine (Col/Epi) and collagen and ADP (Col/ADP) cartridges. Aspirin resistance was defined as having a closure time (CT) of &lt;186 s with Col/Epi cartridges despite regular aspirin therapy. A statin therapy protocol applied to the patients with aspirin resistance for 3 months. RESULTS: We determined that 20 (11.2%) of patients had aspirin resistance by the PFA-100. Mean closure time measured with the Col/ADP cartridges was 83 +/- 18 s (53-162 s). Of the patients 12 were not on a statin therapy and eight were taking 10 mg daily atorvastatin. After 3 months of 40 mg daily atorvastatin therapy 13 subjects with aspirin resistance became aspirin sensitive by PFA-100 (P &lt; 0.0001). There was also a significant decrease in total and LDL cholesterol levels and an increase in HDL cholesterol at the third month of statin therapy (P &lt; 0.0001 for all). CONCLUSION: Statin therapy reduced the in vitro aspirin resistance in 65% of the patients after a therapy of 3 months. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of statins' effects on platelet reactivity

	18022498, ombination of cardiac pacing and epinephrine does not always improve outcome of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.We hypothesized that the combination of cardiac pacing and epinephrine would yield a better efficacy for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the combination of 2 therapies at different opportunity would achieve the same results of CPR. Cardiac arrest was induced by clamping the tracheal tubes in 60 Sprague-Dawley rats. At 10 minutes of asphyxia, the animals were prospectively randomized into 5 groups (n = 12/group), and received saline (Sal-gro, 1 mL, intravenous [i.v.]), epinephrine (Epi-gro, 0.4 mg/kg, i.v.), pacing (Pac-gro, transesophageal cardiac pacing combined with saline 1 mL, i.v.), pacing + epinephrine group 1 (PE-gro1, transesophageal cardiac pacing combined with epinephrine 0.4 mg/kg, i.v.), or pacing + epinephrine group 2 (PE-gro2, transesophageal cardiac pacing combined with epinephrine 0.4 mg/kg, i.v., 4 minutes after the transesophageal cardiac pacing initiating and failing to resuscitate the animals), followed by initiation of CPR. Restoration of spontaneous circulation in Sal-gro was lower than in Epi-gro, Pac-gro, PE-gro1, and PE-gro2 (16.67% vs 66.67%, 66.67%, 100%, and 100%; P &lt; .05 or P &lt; .001, respectively). The proportions of withdrawing ventilator and 2-hour survival proportions in Pac-gro and PE-gro2 were higher than in Epi-gro and PE-gro1 (8/8, 10/12 vs 1/8, 2/12, respectively, P &lt; .01, and 7/8, 8/12 vs 1/8, 2/12, respectively, P &lt; .05 or P &lt; .01). Mean survival time in Pac-gro and PE-gro2 were longer than in Epi-gro and PE-gro1 (P &lt; .05 or P &lt; .01). Therefore, the combination of 2 therapies does not always improve outcome of CPR. It is obvious that the combination of transesophageal cardiac pacing with delayed administration of epinephrine yields a better outcome compared to the combination of 2 therapies at the same time during CPR in a rat asphyxia cardiac arrest model

	18056263, orepinephrine- and epinephrine-induced distinct beta2-adrenoceptor signaling is dictated by GRK2 phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes.Agonist-dependent activation of G protein-coupled receptors induces diversified receptor cellular and signaling properties. Norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (Epi) are two endogenous ligands that activate adrenoceptor (AR) signals in a variety of physiological stress responses in animals. Here we use cardiomyocyte contraction rate response to analyze the endogenous beta(2)AR signaling induced by Epi or NE in cardiac tissue. The Epi-activated beta(2)AR induced a rapid contraction rate increase that peaked at 4 min after stimulation. In contrast, the NE-activated beta(2)AR induced a much slower contraction rate increase that peaked at 10 min after stimulation. Whereas both drugs activated beta(2)AR coupling to G(s) proteins, only Epi-activated receptors were capable of coupling to G(i) proteins. Subsequent studies showed that the Epi-activated beta(2)AR underwent a rapid phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) and subsequent dephosphorylation on serine residues 355 and 356, which was critical for sufficient receptor recycling and G(i) coupling. In contrast, the NE-activated beta(2)ARs underwent slow GRK2 phosphorylation, receptor internalization and recycling, and failed to couple to G(i). Moreover, inhibiting beta(2)AR phosphorylation by betaARK C terminus or dephosphorylation by okadaic acid prevented sufficient recycling and G(i) coupling. Together, our data revealed that distinct temporal phosphorylation of beta(2)AR on serine 355 and 356 by GRK2 plays a critical role for dictating receptor cellular events and signaling properties induced by Epi or NE in cardiomyocytes. This study not only helps us understand the endogenous agonist-dependent beta(2)AR signaling in animal heart but also offers an example of how G protein-coupled receptor signaling may be finely regulated by GRK in physiological settings

	18301218, eta-adrenergic blockade exacerbates sepsis-induced changes in tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 in skeletal muscle and is associated with impaired translation initiation.BACKGROUND: Sepsis stimulates the sympathetic nervous system. The resultant elevation in plasma catecholamines, both norepinephrine and epinephrine (Epi), might be expected to alter the expression of inflammatory cytokines, which may directly or indirectly influence muscle protein balance. The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) determine whether Epi per se increases cytokine expression in skeletal muscle, and (2) determine whether beta-adrenergic blockade alters the sepsis-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines and mediators of protein balance in skeletal muscle. METHODS: In the first study, rats were infused with Epi for 2 hour to increase the circulating Epi concentration to levels seen in septic animals. In the second study, sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture and a nonspecific beta-adrenergic blockade produced with a continuous infusion of propranolol (PP). Tissues were obtained 24 after induction of sepsis and analyzed for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6 mRNA and protein content. In addition, the tissue content of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and various regulators of protein synthesis were assessed. RESULTS: Epi acutely increased TNF-alpha IL-6 and IL-1beta mRNA content in muscle (3- to 40-fold). However, only the TNF-alpha and IL-6 protein content was increased in muscle by Epi. In the second study, beta-adrenergic blockade with PP exacerbated the sepsis-induced increase in muscle IL-6 and TNF-alpha mRNA but did not alter the increment in IL-1beta or HMGB1. Propranolol also accentuated the sepsis-induced increase in both IL-6 and TNF-alpha protein in muscle. The exaggerated muscle cytokine response in septic rats treated with PP was associated with a reduction in muscle IGF-I protein that was greater than detected in saline-infused septic rats. Finally, the combination of sepsis + PP also accentuated the sepsis-induced decrease in the phosphorylation of 4E-binding protein-1, ribosomal protein S6, and mTOR, which are key proteins controlling protein synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that although Epi is capable of increasing tissue cytokines in naive rats, inhibition of the beta-adrenergic effects of catecholamines exacerbates the sepsis-induced increase of selected inflammatory cytokines. This exaggerated tissue response is associated with alterations in muscle IGF-I protein and translation initiation, which would be expected to impair tissue protein synthesis

	18339207, asopressin and epinephrine in the treatment of cardiac arrest: an experimental study.BACKGROUND: Epinephrine remains the drug of choice for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The aim of the present study is to assess whether the combination of vasopressin and epinephrine, given their different mechanisms of action, provides better results than epinephrine alone in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. METHODS: Ventricular fibrillation was induced in 22 Landrace/Large-White piglets, which were left untreated for 8 minutes before attempted resuscitation with precordial compression, mechanical ventilation and electrical defibrillation. Animals were randomized into 2 groups during cardiopulmonary resuscitation: 11 animals who received saline as placebo (20 ml dilution, bolus) + epinephrine (0.02 mg/kg) (Epi group); and 11 animals who received vasopressin (0.4 IU/kg/20 ml dilution, bolus) + epinephrine (0.02 mg/kg) (Vaso-Epi group). Electrical defibrillation was attempted after 10 minutes of ventricular fibrillation. RESULTS: Ten of 11 animals in the Vaso-Epi group restored spontaneous circulation in comparison to only 4 of 11 in the Epi group (p = 0.02). Aortic diastolic pressure, as well as, coronary perfusion pressure were significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the Vaso-Epi group. CONCLUSION: The administration of vasopressin in combination with epinephrine during cardiopulmonary resuscitation results in a drastic improvement in the hemodynamic parameters necessary for the return of spontaneous circulation

	18445148, ingle wavelength micro-endoscopy in non-surgical vascular lesion diagnosis &amp; characterization.Malignant and dysplastic epithelial lesions have often been reported to excite vascular responses by histopathological characterization. Little is reported concerning in vivo real-time imaging of vascular patterns and flow in health or disease but the development of miniature imaging instrumentation has now allowed such developments. We describe the application of a selective wavelength (540 nm) epi-illumination Hopkins pattern endoscopic imaging system to image vascular tissues and capillary blood flow in vivo. The contrast mechanism in such imaging was characterized, haemoglobin acting as a chromatic transmission filter despite endoscopy being a non-invasive and therefore principally reflection mode imaging system. In vivo adrenergic vascular responses, capillary flow rate variations over time and variations in normal capillary architecture around the oral cavity were recorded; demonstrating that simple imaging systems can be used for non-surgical diagnosis and characterization of vascular lesions, tumours and treatment responses

	18620815, he role of doxorubicin and epirubicin in the treatment of patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer.Advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) is characterized by prevalently osteoblastic bone metastases which are what mostly affect these patients' quality of life and make the assessment of response to treatment particularly difficult by commonly used criteria. HRPC cannot be cured by any available therapeutic option, and chemotherapy has to be still considered as a palliative treatment. The anthracyclines doxorubicin (Dox) and epirubicin (Epi), alone or in combination with other agents, have been extensively used in the treatment of HRPC, but controversial results have been reported. The majority of reviewed studies reported a pain reduction in &gt;50% of patients receiving Dox or Epi, suggesting a substantial palliative effect by their use in metastatic HRPC. The weekly schedule of anthracyclines seemed to achieve similar results to the 3-weekly schedule but with a better toxicity profile. Although the toxic adverse effects were usually manageable when anthracyclines were combined with other agents, toxicity was severe by a number of aggressive regimens. Docetaxel is today approved for the treatment of HRPC, and must be considered the standard platform on which new agents may be combined. Given that HRPC includes a heterogeneous group of patients with variable rates of tumour growth, the combination of docetaxel with active agents such as anthracyclines may deserve further clinical investigation

	18626080, n vivo regulation of rainbow trout lipolysis by catecholamines.Lipolysis provides fatty acids that support key life processes by functioning as membrane components, oxidative fuels and metabolic signals. It is commonly measured as the rate of appearance of glycerol (Ra glycerol). Its in vivo regulation by catecholamines has been thoroughly investigated in mammals, but little information is available for ectotherms. Therefore, the goals of this study were, first, to characterize the effects of the catecholamines norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (Epi) on the lipolytic rate of intact rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and, second, to determine whether the plasma glycerol concentration is a reliable index of Ra glycerol. Our results show that baseline Ra glycerol (4.6+/-0.4 micromol kg(-1) min(-1)) is inhibited by NE (-56%), instead of being stimulated, as in mammals, whereas Epi has the same activating effect in both groups of vertebrates (+167%). NE-induced inhibition of fish lipolysis might play a particularly important role during aquatic hypoxia, when survival often depends on regulated metabolic depression. The plasma glycerol concentration is a poor predictor of Ra glycerol, and it should not be used as an index of lipolysis. Trout maintain a particularly high baseline lipolytic rate because only 13% of the fatty acids provided are sufficient to support total energy expenditure, whereas the remaining fatty acids must undergo reesterification (87%)

	18751928, ntiplatelet agents sarpogrelate and cilostazol affect experimentally-induced ventricular arrhythmias and mortality.Antiplatelet agents, sarpogrelate (SAR), a 5-hydroxy tryptamine 2A receptor antagonist and cilostazol (CIL), a phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor, were observed to be beneficial in attenuating cardiac remodeling and improving cardiac function in congestive heart failure due to myocardial infarction in rats; however, CIL increased ventricular tachycardia and mortality. In order to study the effects of these antiplatelet agents on arrhythmias, Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with either SAR or CIL (5 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks and were then either injected cumulative doses of epinephrine (Epi) or subjected to coronary occlusion. Saline-treated animals served as controls. Electrocardiographic analysis revealed that SAR pretreatment decreased the incidence and severity of ventricular arrhythmias (time of onset of arrhythmias as well as the occurrence of premature ventricular contractions, salvos, tachycardia, and fibrillations), whereas CIL treatment augmented the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias due to both Epi and coronary occlusion. None of the drugs affected the corrected QT interval significantly. Furthermore, the levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in left ventricle were markedly higher in CIL-pretreated rats when compared to SAR-pretreated or control rats. It is suggested that an excessive level of cAMP may contribute to increase incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and mortality in animals pretreated with CIL, unlike the SAR-pretreated rats

	18768436, ype 1 receptor tyrosine kinase profiles identify patients with enhanced benefit from anthracyclines in the BR9601 adjuvant breast cancer chemotherapy trial.PURPOSE: Patients with early breast cancer who receive anthracycline-containing chemotherapy experience improved relapse-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with those who receive non-anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. Such benefit, however, may be restricted to women whose tumors have specific molecular characteristics. We tested the hypothesis that HER2, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr)/HER1, HER3, Ki67, and topoisomerase IIalpha expression are predictive of outcome after anthracycline-based chemotherapy. METHODS: Tissue microarrays from 322 of 374 women in the BR9601 trial, which compared cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) with epirubicin followed by CMF (epi-CMF), were analyzed for HER1, 2, 3, 4; Ki67; and topoisomerase IIalpha protein expression and for HER2/topoisomerase IIalpha gene amplification. Their relationships to RFS and OS were investigated, and multiple regression analysis was used to identify interactions. RESULTS: A significant interaction was seen between tumors with normal HER1, HER2 fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), or HER3 levels and the enhanced benefit from epi-CMF versus CMF for RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.36; HR for overexpressed HER1 or HER2 FISH or HER3, 0.92; P = .035) and for OS (HR, 0.30; HR for overexpressed HER1 or HER2 FISH or HER3), 0.98; P = .023). Neither Ki67 nor TIIalpha expressions or gene alterations showed clear predictive value for benefit from the addition of the anthracycline. CONCLUSION: Patients with HER2 amplified and those with HER1, HER2 FISH, or HER3-positive tumors did not benefit from the addition of epirubicin to CMF. Conversely, patients with HER2 nonamplified and HER1 through HER3-negative tumors showed significantly increased RFS and OS rates when treated with epi-CMF compared with CMF

	18814973, locking of beta-2 adrenergic receptors hastens recovery from hypoglycemia-associated social withdrawal.OBJECTIVE: Hypoglycemia is associated with a variety of adverse behaviors including fatigue, confusion and social withdrawal. While these clinical symptoms are well characterized, the mechanism of their cause is not understood. Here we investigated how insulin-induced hypoglycemia causes social withdrawal. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Male 8-12-week-old C57BL/6J mice were injected intraperitoneally (IP) with or without and/or insulin, norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (Epi), terbutaline and butoxamine with subsequent measurement of blood glucose, social withdrawal and plasma catecholamines. RESULTS: Insulin generated (0.75h post-injection) significant hypoglycemia with blood glucose nadirs of 64+/-4 and 48+/-5mg/dl for 0.8 and 1.2units/kg of insulin, respectively. Insulin (0.8 or 1.2units/kg) caused near total social withdrawal at 0.75h with full recovery not occurring until 4h (0.8units/kg) or 8h (1.2units/kg) post-insulin injection. Insulin also caused a marked elevation in plasma catecholamines. Basal 12h fasting NE and Epi were 287+/-38 and 350+/-47pg/ml, respectively. Insulin at 0.8units/kg increased plasma NE and Epi to 994+/-73 and 1842+/-473pg/ml, respectively. Administration of exogenous NE or Epi caused social withdrawal similar in magnitude to insulin. Importantly, administration of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist terbutaline also caused social withdrawal while administration of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist butoxamine blocked NE-induced social withdrawal. Finally, butoxamine blocked insulin-induced social withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that hypoglycemia-associated social withdrawal is dependent on catecholamines via a beta-2 receptor-mediated pathway

	18955128, tress-induced changes in the expression of monocytic beta2-integrins: the impact of arousal of negative affect and adrenergic responses to the Anger Recall Interview.Adhesion of circulating monocytes to the vascular endothelium is one of the earliest steps in the development of atherosclerosis. This leukocyte-to-endothelium interaction is mediated in part by beta2-integrins, a group of cell adhesion molecules that bind to endothelial ligands. Given the significance of this interaction to atherogenesis, we examined the effects of stress, operationalized as the arousal of negative affect (NA) and cardiovascular and catecholamine responses to the Anger Recall Interview (ARI), on the expression of LFA-1 (CD11a), Mac-1 (CD11b) and p150/95 (CD11c) on circulating monocytes (CD14+). Subjects were 173 healthy, nonsmoking men and women (60% men, 40% minorities, aged 18-49 year). Arousal of NA, cardiovascular responses (heart rate [HR], systolic blood pressure [SBP], diastolic blood pressure [DBP]), circulating catecholamines (epinephrine [Epi], norepinephrine [Ne]) and beta2-integrin (CD11/CD18) expression were determined prior to and following the ARI. The principal findings were that the ARI, on average, induced a decrease in monocyte expression of beta2-integrins. However, after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, exercise status, and baseline level of beta2-integrin expression, those individuals who showed the largest increases in NA, Ne and DBP during the ARI showed an increase in monocyte beta2-integrin expression. Thus, heightened psychological and physiological stress responses induced phenotypic changes in monocytic expression of beta2-integrins that are consistent with the role of monocytes/macrophages in vascular inflammation and increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease

	19111117, The influence of anisodamine on cardiopulmonary resuscitation in rat]OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of anisodamine (Ani) on restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) rate in a randomized, blinded experimental study so as to explore a new treatment for CPR. METHODS: Forty-five Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomized to three groups: control group (0.9% normal saline), epinephrine (Epi) group and Epi plus Ani group (combined group), 15 rats in each group. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) or asystole was induced by transoesophageal alternating current stimulation. A blinded drug administration and mechanical chest compression were used in this study (Epi 200 microg/kg, Ani 10 mg/kg). ROSC rate and resuscitation rate were compared among these groups. RESULTS: Combined group had higher ROSC rate(93.3% vs. 46.7%), resuscitation rate (80.0% vs.33.3%) and survival rate within 3 hours (83.3% vs.20.0%) compared with Epi group (all P&lt;0.05). ROSC occurred only in one rat of control group. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) at the beginning of ROSC in Epi group was higher compared with combined group (P&lt;0.05). After ROSC, MAP decreased in both drug groups, especially after 5 minutes of ROSC, and MAP in Epi group was lower than that of combined group. There was difference between the two groups till 30 minutes after ROSC (all P&lt;0.05) . CONCLUSION: Administration of Epi plus Ani at the beginning of treatment for cardiac arrest could improve ROSC rate and resuscitation rate

	19111123, Effects of anisodamine on microcirculation of the asystole rats during the cardiopulmonary resuscitation]OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of anisodamine (Ani) on microcirculation and reperfusion volume of intestine wall in Wistar rats during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for cardiac arrest (CA). METHODS: Healthy Wistar rats subjected to CA and resuscitation were randomly divided into four groups, 15 rats in each group. After a 4-minute-non-intervention interval, CPR was started. After CPR for 4 minutes the animals in control group received normal saline, group epinephrine (Epi) received Epi (bolus dose of 200 microg/kg), Epi plus low dosage Ani (Ld Ani) group received Epi plus Ani (bolus dose of 200 microg/kg Epi followed by Ani of 5 mg/kg), and Epi plus high dosage Ani (Hd Ani) group received Epi plus Ani (bolus dose of 200 microg/kg Epi followed by Ani of 10 mg/kg). The recanalization rate of mesenteric arterioles and venules, caliber of the recanalized mesentery arteriole and venule, and the reperfusion volume of intestine wall were observed in vivo in rats with restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). RESULTS: As the rate of recanalization of mesenteric arterioles and venules was compared, group Hd Ani (66.6%, 60.0%)&gt;group Ld Ani (60.0%, 53.3%)&gt;group control (40.0%, 40.0%)&gt;group Epi (26.7%, 20.0%), and group Ld Ani and group Hd Ani was much better than group Epi(all P&lt;0.05). When the caliber of arterioles and venules was compared, group Hd Ani&gt;group Ld Ani&gt;group control&gt;group Epi 30 minutes and 60 minutes after ROSC. Thirty minutes after ROSC, the caliber of arterioles and venules was much larger in group Ld Ani and group Hd Ani than that in group Epi (all P&lt;0.05). Sixty minutes after ROSC, there was no statistical difference in the caliber of venules between group Ld Ani and group Epi, so as between group Ld Ani and group Hd Ani. Reperfusion volume of intestine wall in group Ld Ani and group Hd Ani was higher than that in groups control and Epi 15 minutes after ROSC, and it kept on to be better up to 60 minutes after ROSC. CONCLUSION: Administration of Ani at earlier period of resuscitation could improve microcirculation of the tissue and raise ROSC rate and successful rate of resuscitation

	19120117, drenergic responses to stress: transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes.Stress effects on adrenergic responses in rats were examined in adrenal medulla, the primary source of circulating epinephrine (Epi). Irrespective of duration, immobilization (IMMO) increased adrenal corticosterone to the same extent. In contrast, Epi changed little, suggesting that Epi synthesis replenishes adrenal pools and sustains circulating levels for the heightened alertness and physiological changes required of the  flight or fight  response. IMMO also induced the Epi-synthesizing enzyme, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT). The rise in its mRNA and protein was preceded by increases in Egr-1 and Sp1 mRNA, protein, and protein-DNA binding complex formation. With repeated and prolonged stress, PNMT protein did not reflect the magnitude of change in mRNA. The latter suggests that post-transcriptional, in addition to transcriptional mechanisms, regulate PNMT responses to stress. To further reveal molecular mechanisms underlying stress-induced changes in adrenergic function, the effects of hypoxia on PNMT promoter-driven gene expression are being examined in adrenal medulla-derived PC12 cells. Hypoxia activates the PNMT promoter to increase PNMT promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene expression and endogenous PNMT in PC12 cells. Induction of both appear mediated via activation of multiple signaling pathways and downstream activation of hypoxia inducible factor and PNMT transcriptional activators, Egr-1 and Sp1. Hypoxia generates both partially and fully processed forms of PNMT mRNA. The former reportedly is translated into a truncated, nonfunctional protein, and the latter into enzymatically active PNMT. Together, findings suggest that stress increases PNMT gene transcriptional activity but post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms limit the biological end-point of functional PNMT enzyme and, thereby, Epi

	19148555, redictive value of survivin alternative transcript expression in locally advanced breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Survivin, a member of the apoptosis inhibitor protein family, is expressed in numerous human tumours, and its expression is described as a negative prognostic marker. Four alternative splice variants (survivin-DeltaEx3, survivin-3B, survivin-2B and survivin-2alpha) have been described. To date, little is known about the prognostic or predictive role of all five survivin transcripts in breast cancer. In this study, we analysed, by means of real-time quantitative PCR, the five survivin transcripts in a population of 60 breast carcinoma patients treated with 5-fluorouracil + epirubicin + cyclophosphamide (FEC, n=32) or with docetaxel + epirubicin (Tax-Epi, n=28). For each patient, samples were obtained before and after one course of chemotherapy. Before treatment, the ratio of survivin-2alpha was significantly higher in resistant than in sensitive tumours treated by the FEC regimen (p=0.0161), while the ratio of survivin-DeltaEx3 was higher in sensitive than in resistant samples treated with Tax-Epi (p=0.0234). After one course of chemotherapy, expression of survivin-3B was significantly associated with resistance (p=0.0448) in the FEC treatment group, and the ratios of survivin-DeltaEx3 (p=0.0071) and survivin-2B (p=0.0380) were significantly higher in sensitive than in resistant tumours in the Tax-Epi treatment group. Notably, increased expression and ratio of survivin-3B after one course of Tax-Epi was associated with reduced disease-free survival (p=0.0299 and 0.0277, respectively) and with reduced overall survival (p=0.0145 and &lt;0.0001, respectively) of the patients. These results indicate that an imbalance in the alternative transcript ratios may make the cells resistant or sensitive to apoptosis. They also demonstrate for the first time that alternative survivin transcript expression levels may be predictive markers in FEC and Tax-Epi treatment in breast carcinoma

	19185242, ptimizing the intracameral dilation regimen for cataract surgery: prospective randomized comparison of 2 solutions.PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of epi-Shugarcaine solution (epinephrine 0.025% and lidocaine 0.75% in fortified balanced salt solution [BSS Plus]) (epi-S) and Lundberg and Behndig's intracameral dilation solution (cyclopentolate 0.1%, phenylephrine 1.5%, and lidocaine 1%) (LB) for intracameral dilation for cataract surgery. SETTING: Private clinic, Lincolnwood, Illinois, USA. METHODS: In this paired-eye single-masked prospective study, the first eye scheduled for surgery was randomized to receive LB solution or epi-S solution intracamerally at the time of cataract surgery; the second eye to have surgery received the alternative solution. Each eye received 1 drop of tropicamide 1% at least 20 minutes before the start of surgery. Pupil measurements were made before the incision was created, 1 minute after intracameral solution injection, after the anterior chamber was filled with an ophthalmic viscosurgical device, and at the conclusion of the case. Pupil size was objectively graded via software operated by a video technician who was masked to which solution was used. RESULTS: Eighty-four eyes of 42 patients were enrolled in the study. At each time point after instillation, the pupil was statistically significantly larger with epi-S solution than with LB solution, averaging 0.528 mm larger 1 minute after instillation (mean 7.183 versus 6.665 mm) to 0.34 mm larger (mean 7.381 versus 7.040 mm) by the end of the case. CONCLUSION: When combined with 1 drop of tropicamide 1% preoperatively, both formulations provided safe and effective intracameral dilation for cataract surgery; however, the epi-S solution was the more efficacious at each step of the procedure

	19211521, oncurrent supplementation of arginine, vitamin E, and vitamin C improve cardiopulmonary performance in broilers chickens.Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of arginine, vitamin E (VE), and vitamin C (VC) on cardiopulmonary performance and ascites parameters of broilers reared under a cold environmental temperature. One-day-old male broilers were fed a basal corn-soybean meal diet (control, 1.2% arginine and 40 IU of VE), or the basal diet supplemented with 1% arginine and either 200 IU vitamin E (AE), 500 mg of vitamin C (AC), or a combination of VE and VC at the same amounts (AEC) per kilogram of feed. Pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and mean arterial pressure were recorded in clinically healthy, anesthetized birds (28 to 42 d old) before and after an epinephrine (Epi) challenge (0.5 mg/kg of BW, i.v.), an aminoguanidine hemisulfate challenge (100 mg/kg of BW, i.v.), and an N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester challenge (50 mg/kg of BW, i.v.) at 20-min intervals. Data were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA, and the Student Newman-Keuls test was used to separate means within groups. The PAP increased 30 s after the Epi challenge in all birds, but the peak PAP was lower in the AEC group than in all the other groups, whereas birds in the AE and AC groups had lower PAP peaks than did the control group. After 120 s of challenge, the PAP was lower in AEC birds compared with the other birds. The PAP returned to pre-Epi amounts within 300 s in all groups. The PAP was increased (P &lt; 0.05) within 60 s after the aminoguanidine hemisulfate and N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester challenges in all groups, but no differences were found among groups. The mean arterial pressure responses did not differ among groups. Plasma NO was greater in the AEC group than in all the other groups before and after the Epi challenge. These results showed that Epi elicited lower amplitude PAP and less prolonged increases in PAP in birds from the AEC group, and this may have been related to the increased vasodilation attributable to NO production. The AEC may have had complementary effects against oxidative stress, protecting the endothelium and preserving NO function

	19289831, he two-component system QseEF and the membrane protein QseG link adrenergic and stress sensing to bacterial pathogenesis.Bacterial pathogens sense host cues to activate expression of virulence genes. Most of these signals are sensed through histidine kinases (HKs), which comprise the main sensory mechanism in bacteria. The host stress hormones epinephrine (Epi) and norepinephrine are sensed through the QseC HK, which initiates a complex signaling cascade to regulate virulence gene expression in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). Epi signaling through QseC activates expression of the genes encoding the QseEF 2-component system. QseE is an HK, and QseF is a response regulator. Here, we show that QseE is a second bacterial adrenergic receptor that gauges the stress signals Epi, sulfate, and phosphate. The qseEF genes are organized within an unusual operonic structure, in that a gene is encoded between qseE and qseF. This gene was renamed qseG, and it was shown to encode an outer membrane (OM) protein. EHEC uses a type III secretion system (TTSS) to translocate effector proteins to the epithelial cells that rearrange the host cytoskeleton to form pedestal-like structures that cup the bacterium. QseE, QseG, and QseF are necessary for pedestal formation. Although QseE and QseF are involved in the transcriptional control of genes necessary for pedestal formation, QseG is necessary for translocation of effectors into epithelial cells. QseG is an OM protein necessary for translocation of TTSS effectors that also works in conjunction with a 2-component signaling system that senses host stress signals

	19407251, reater systemic lipolysis in women compared with men during moderate-dose infusion of epinephrine and/or norepinephrine.Women have lower circulating catecholamine levels during metabolic perturbations, such as exercise or hypoglycemia, but similar rates of systemic lipolysis. This suggests women may be more sensitive to the lipolytic action of catecholamines, while maintaining similar glucoregulatory effects. The aim of the present study, therefore, was to determine whether women have higher rates of systemic lipolysis compared with men in response to matched peripheral infusion of catecholamines, but similar rates of glucose turnover. Healthy, nonobese women (n = 11) and men (n = 10) were recruited and studied on 3 separate days with the following infusions: epinephrine (Epi), norepinephrine (NE), or the two combined. Tracer infusions of glycerol and glucose were used to determine systemic lipolysis and glucose turnover, respectively. Following basal measurements of substrate kinetics, the catecholamine infusion commenced, and measures of substrate kinetics continued for 60 min. Catecholamine concentrations were similarly elevated in women and men during each infusion: Epi, 182-197 pg/ml and NE, 417-507 pg/ml. There was a significant sex difference in glycerol rate of appearance and rate of disappearance with the catecholamine infusions (P &lt; 0.0001), mainly due to a significantly greater glycerol turnover during the first 30 min of each infusion: glycerol rate of appearance during Epi was only 268 +/- 18 vs. 206 +/- 21 micromol/min in women and men, respectively; during NE, only 173 +/- 13 vs. 153 +/- 17 micromol/min, and during Epi+NE, 303 +/- 24 vs. 257 +/- 21 micromol/min. No sex differences were observed in glucose kinetics under any condition. In conclusion, these data suggest that women are more sensitive to the lipolytic action of catecholamines, but have no difference in their glucoregulatory response. Thus the lower catcholamine levels observed in women vs. men during exercise and other metabolic perturbations may allow women to maintain a similar or greater level of lipid mobilization while minimizing changes in glucose turnover

	19429229, levated serum soluble Fas ligand is a promising marker of testicular toxicity induced by epirubicin in rats.To investigate the role of the Fas/Fas ligand (Fas/FasL) system in testicular toxicity induced by epirubicin (Epi) and to correlate the system with the serum levels of soluble Fas and Fas ligand (sFas/sFasL), epirubicin was intraperitoneally administered to male Sprague-Dawley male rats at doses of 1.2mg/kg once a week for 10 weeks, and genital organ weights and histopathology were examined. Fas and FasL expression in rat testis were examined by immunohistochemistry. Apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL assay. Expression levels of Fas and FasL were analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Serum sFas/sFasL levels were determined by ELISA. The results show that the testicular toxicity of Epi involved germ cell apoptosis. Fas and FasL protein expression levels were markedly increased in Epi-treated rat testes, as was expression of sFasL. In particular, increasing serum sFasL levels were positively correlated with elevated expression levels of FasL and sFasL in the testes of Epi-treated rats, revealing serum sFasL to be a promising marker of testicular toxicity after cytotoxic chemotherapy

	19444233, eta-adrenergic-AMPK pathway phosphorylates acetyl-CoA carboxylase in a high-epinephrine rat model, SPORTS.We established a new animal model called SPORTS (Spontaneously-Running Tokushima-Shikoku) rats, which show high-epinephrine (Epi) levels. Recent reports show that Epi activates adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in adipocytes. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) is the rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid synthesis, and the enzymatic activity is suppressed when its Ser-79 is phosphorylated by AMPK. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vivo effect of Epi on ACC and abdominal visceral fat accumulation. We divided both 6-week male control and SPORTS rats into two groups, which were fed either normal diet or high fat and sucrose (HFS) diet for 16 weeks. At the end of diet treatment, retroperitoneal fat was collected for western blotting and histological analysis. Food intake was not different among the groups, but SPORTS rats showed significantly lower weight gain than control rats in both diet groups. After 10 weeks of diet treatment, glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) revealed that SPORTS rats had increased insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, SPORTS rats had lower quantities of both abdominal fat and plasma triglyceride (TG). In abdominal fat, elevated ACC Ser-79 phosphorylation was observed in SPORTS rats and suppressed by an antagonist of beta-adrenergic receptor (AR), propranolol, or an inhibitor of AMPK, Compound C. From these results, high level of Epi induced ACC phosphorylation mediated through beta-AR and AMPK signaling pathways in abdominal visceral fat of SPORTS rats, which may contribute to reduce abdominal visceral fat accumulation and increase insulin sensitivity. Our results suggest that beta-AR-regulated ACC activity would be a target for treating lifestyle-related diseases, such as obesity

	19460844, drenergic activation of electrogenic K+ secretion in guinea pig distal colonic epithelium: involvement of beta1- and beta2-adrenergic receptors.Adrenergic stimulation of electrogenic K+ secretion in isolated mucosa from guinea pig distal colon required activation of two beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes (beta-AdrR). Addition of epinephrine (epi) or norepinephrine (norepi) to the bathing solution of mucosae in Ussing chambers increased short-circuit current (Isc) and transepithelial conductance (Gt), consistent with this cation secretion. A beta-adrenergic classification was supported by propranolol antagonism of this secretory response and the lack of effect by the alpha-AdrR antagonists BE2254 (alpha1-AdrR) and yohimbine (alpha2-AdrR). Subtype-selective antagonists CGP20712A (beta1-AdrR), ICI-118551 (beta2-AdrR), and SR59320A (beta3-AdrR) were relatively ineffective at inhibiting the epi-stimulated Isc response. In combination, CGP20712A and ICI-118551 inhibited the response, which supported a synergistic action by beta1-AdrR and beta2-AdrR. Expression of mRNA for both beta1-AdrR and beta2-AdrR was indicated by RT-PCR of RNA from colonic epithelial cells. Protein expression was indicated by immunoblot showing bands at molecular weights consistent with monomers and oligomers. Immunoreactivity (ir) for beta1-AdrR and beta2-AdrR was prominent in basolateral membranes of columnar epithelial cells in the crypts of Lieberkühn as well as intercrypt surface epithelium. Cells in the pericryptal sheath also had beta1-AdrR(ir) but did not have discernable beta2-AdrR(ir). The adrenergic sensitivity of K+ secretion measured by Isc and Gt was relatively low as indicated by EC(50)s of 41 +/- 7 nM for epi and 50 +/- 14 nM for norepi. Adrenergic activation of electrogenic K+ secretion required the involvement of both beta1-AdrR and beta2-AdrR, occurring with an agonist sensitivity reduced compared with reported values for either receptor subtype

	19479487, ariations in gene expression and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast carcinoma.In this study, we performed a screening of 266 gene expressions in breast carcinomas and carried out correlations with histological response to either FEC-100 (fluorouracil-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide; n = 16) or Tax-Epi (docetaxel-epirubicin; n = 12) treatment. Gene expression in biopsies obtained before and after one course of chemotherapy was analyzed. Expression of specific genes was significantly changed after one course of chemotherapy, particularly for Tax-Epi treatment. Comparison with histological response for both treatments revealed that only good responders exhibited changes in gene-expression profile. These results agree that expression of different genes changes in response to anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy and show, for the first time, that response to docetaxel-based treatment implied also changes in gene-expression profile

	19497958, drenergic activation of electrogenic K+ secretion in guinea pig distal colonic epithelium: desensitization via the Y2-neuropeptide receptor.Adrenergic activation of electrogenic K+ secretion in isolated mucosa from guinea pig distal colon was desensitized by peptide-YY (PYY). Addition of PYY or neuropeptide-Y (NPY) to the bathing solution of mucosae in Ussing chambers suppressed the short-circuit current (Isc) corresponding to electrogenic Cl- secretion, whether stimulated by epinephrine (epi), prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2), or carbachol (CCh). Neither peptide markedly inhibited the large transient component of synergistic secretion (PGE2 + CCh). Sustained Cl- secretory Isc was inhibited approximately 65% by PYY or NPY, with IC50s of 4.1 +/- 0.9 nM and 9.4 +/- 3.8 nM, respectively. This inhibition was eliminated by BIIE0246, an antagonist of the Y2-neuropeptide receptor (Y2-NpR), but not by Y1-NpR antagonist BVD10. Adrenergic sensitivity for activation of K+ secretion in the presence of Y2-NpR blockade by BIIE0246 was (EC50s) 2.9 +/- 1.2 nM for epi and 13.3 +/- 1.0 nM for norepinephrine, approximately fourfold greater than in the presence of PYY. Expression of mRNA for both Y1-NpR and Y2-NpR was indicated by RT-PCR of RNA from colonic mucosa, and protein expression was indicated by immunoblot. Immunoreactivity (ir) for Y1-NpR and Y2-NpR was distinct in basolateral membranes of columnar epithelial cells in the crypts of Lieberkühn as well as intercrypt surface epithelium. Adrenergic nerves in proximity with crypts were detected by ir for dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, and a portion of these nerves also contained NPY(ir). BIIE0246 addition increased secretagog-activated Isc, consistent with in vitro release of either PYY or NPY. Thus PYY and NPY were able to suppress Cl- secretory capacity and desensitize the adrenergic K+ secretory response, providing a direct inhibitory counterbalance against secretory activation

	19664643, odification of endothelial biology by acute and chronic stress hormones.OBJECTIVE: An increasing number of studies have examined the role of emotional stress and coronary heart disease; the underlying pathophysiology is still poorly understood. The present study was designed to evaluate the relationship between acute (epi- and norepinephrine) and chronic stress hormones (dexamethasone, beta-endorphin, corticotropin releasing hormone) and endothelial dysfunction. METHODS: Human microvascular endothelial cells were incubated with stress hormones for 6 and 24 h. ET-1 release and ADMA were quantified via ELISA, NO release by using cell permeable 4.5-diaminofluorescein diacetate (DAF2-DA), oxidative stress fluometrically by the ROS-sensitive carboxy-H2-DCFDA method, mitochondrial metabolic activity by using the colorimetric assay WST-1, ET-1 receptor type A (ET(A)R) protein expression by Western blot, and cell proliferation activity was assessed by the colorimetric assay BrdU. RESULTS: With respect to analysed acute and chronic stress hormones, ET-1 release was significantly increased. Likewise, protein expression was enhanced after long term incubation (24 h) with norepinephrine and dexamethasone. In contrast, endothelial NO-levels were only influenced by short term stimulation of dexamethasone (upregulation of NO release) and norepinephrine (downregulation of NO release), whereas modified NO concentration mimics altered mitochondrial metabolic activity. Unexpectedly, both oxidative stress and cell proliferation were not modified by stress hormones. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that acute and chronic stress hormones induce a significant ET-1 release whereas NO release remained mainly unchanged. The imbalance of pro- and antiatherosclerotic factors may play a pivotal role in the initiation of stress-related endothelial dysfunction up to myocardial infarction

	19682512, linical experience with anthracycline antibiotics-HPMA copolymer-human immunoglobulin conjugates.This paper reviews an early clinical experience with anthracycline (epirubicin; Epi or doxorubicin; Dox) containing an N-(2-hydroyxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymer carrier targeted with autologous or commercial human immunoglobulin in six patients aged 28-55 suffering from therapy-resistant metastatic cancer. More than 100 biochemical, hematological and immunological parameters, including nine tumor markers, were tested in blood samples taken 24 h after the first and up to 10 months after the last application. The intravenous application proceeded without serious adverse or side effects and did not require hospitalization. Cardiotoxicity was not observed. Four of six monitored patients attained stabilization of disease (liver ultrasound scan and bone computer tomography) with a very good quality of life lasting from seven up to 18 months. Positive response to the treatment was, among others, evaluated as decreased CA 15-3 and CEA tumor markers. In three of five tested patients the serum level of C-reactive protein was temporarily increased 72 h after the treatment. A stable or elevated number of peripheral blood reticulocytes together with activation of natural killer (NK) cells and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells supports the data previously obtained in experimental animals pointing to a dual role, i.e. the cytotoxic and immunomobilizing character of doxorubicin-HPMA conjugates

	19923980, mpact of genetic polymorphisms on platelet function and aspirin resistance.Genetic polymorphisms may affect platelets' responses to the antiplatelet therapy. Our aim was to determine the role of genetic polymorphisms on aspirin resistance in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). A total of 126 consecutive patients (35-85 years old, 32% women) with chronic stable CHD was enrolled in the study. Platelet function assays were realized by the platelet function analyzer (PFA)-100 with collagen and epinephrine (Col/Epi) and collagen and adenosine diphosphate (Col/ADP) cartridges. Aspirin resistance was defined as having a closure time of less than 186 s with Col/Epi cartridges despite regular aspirin therapy. Factor V, prothrombin, factor XIII, beta-fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor I (PAI-1), glycoprotein IIIa, methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase, ACE and ApoB gene polymorphisms were determined by three consecutive steps: isolation and amplification of DNA and reverse hybridization. We determined that 30 patients (23.8%) had aspirin resistance by the PFA-100. Mean closure time measured with the Col/ADP cartridges was 74 +/- 12 s (51-104 s). Ten of the 30 patients with aspirin resistance were women (33.3%). Genetic polymorphisms were determined in 30 aspirin-resistant and 17 aspirin-sensitive patients. No statistically significant relationship was determined between aspirin resistance and the genetic panel. In our study we did not determine a significant relationship between the aspirin resistance and factor V, prothrombin, factor XIII, beta-fibrinogen, PAI-1, glycoprotein IIIa, methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase, ACE and ApoB gene polymorphisms

	20031290, elypressin, but not epinephrine, reduces myocardial oxygen tension after an injection of dental local anesthetic solution at routine doses.PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of epinephrine (Epi) or felypressin (Fely) contained in dental local anesthetics on myocardial oxygen balance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Japanese White tracheotomized rabbits were anesthetized with isoflurane. Three doses of 0.18, 0.36, and 0.72 mL of 2% lidocaine hydrochloride containing 1:80,000 Epi or 3% prilocaine hydrochloride containing Fely 0.03 IU/mL were injected into the rabbit tongue muscle. These doses were equivalent to 2, 4, and 8 of dental local anesthetic cartridges in humans weighing 50 kg by body weight correction, respectively. Heart rate, blood pressure, aortic blood flow, myocardial tissue blood flow, and myocardial tissue oxygen tension were continuously monitored. Data were recorded immediately before and 10, 20, 30, and 60 minutes after the injection. RESULTS: Heart rate decreased in the Fely group. Systolic blood pressure increased in the Epi group, and diastolic blood pressure increased in both groups. Aortic blood flow and myocardial tissue blood flow increased, whereas myocardial tissue oxygen tension did not change in the Epi group. In contrast, aortic blood flow, myocardial tissue blood flow, and myocardial tissue oxygen tension decreased in the Fely group. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that Fely, but not Epi, decreases myocardial oxygen tension and aggravates myocardial oxygen demand/supply balance even after an injection of dental local anesthetic solution at routine doses

	8270769, ynergistic interactions between two skeletal mutations in mice: individual and combined effects of the semidominants cleidocranial dysplasia (Ccd) and short digits (Dsh).Heterozygotes for cleidocranial dysplasia (Ccd) and short digits (Dsh) were crossed to test whether synergistic interactions occur between different dominant mutations whose individual pleiotropic phenotypic effects exhibit a common feature. These unlinked mutations are homozygous lethal, and they are congenic on the C57BL/10 background. Each mutation caused more than 10 different anomalies and showed variable expressivity. Each mutation produced several malformations that were present in every heterozygote. Seven different synergistic interactions were found, including one that yielded an entirely new abnormality not predicted from any abnormalities found in either of the single heterozygotes. Although synergistic interactions between dominant mutations have not, to our knowledge, been described in humans, these findings in mice increase the probability that they occur in humans. Under certain circumstances in human populations, the segregation of mutations causing synergistic interactions of the type demonstrated might be confused with recessive inheritance. It will be important to learn whether synergistic interactions can occur between other mutations. If they can, it will probably become important to take synergistic interactions into account when estimating the genetic hazards to humans from mutagens. Three antagonistic interactions were also found

	10352935,  chromosomal polymorphisms reveal founding lineages in the Finns and the Saami.Y chromosomal polymorphisms were studied in 502 males from 16 Eurasian ethnic groups including the Finns, Saami (Inari Lake area and Skolt Saami), Karelians, Mari, Mokshas, Erzas, Hungarians (Budapest area and Csángós), Khanty, Mansi, Yakuts, Koryaks, Nivkhs, Mongolians, and Latvians. The samples were analysed for polymorphisms in the Y chromosome specific Alu insertion (YAP) and six microsatellites (DYS19, DYS389-I and II, DYS390, DYS392, DYS393). The populations were also screened for the recently described Tat polymorphism. The incidence of YAP+ type was highest in the Csángós and in other Hungarians (37.5% and 17.5%, respectively). In the Karelians and the Latvians it was present at approximately the same level as commonly found in other European populations, whilst absent in our further samples of Eurasian populations, including the Finns and the Saami. Aside from the Hungarians, the C allele of the Tat polymorphism was common in all the Finno-Ugric speaking populations (from 8.2% to 63.2%), with highest incidence in the Ob-Ugrian Khanty. The C allele was also found in the Latvians (29.4%). The haplotypes found associated with the Tat C allele showed consistently lower density than those associated with the T allele, indicating that the T allele is the original form. The computation of the age of the Tat C suggested that the mutation might be a relatively recent event giving a maximum likelihood estimate of 4440 years (95% confidence interval about 3140-6200 years). The distribution patterns of the 222 haplotypes found varied considerably among the populations. In the Finns a majority of the haplotypes could be assigned to two distinct groups, one of which harboured the C allele of the Tat polymorphism, indicating dichotomous primary source of genetic variation among Finnish males. The presence of a bottleneck or founding effect in the male lineages of some of the populations, namely in the Finns and the Saami, would appear to be one likely interpretation for these findings

	10381523, xpression of the human immunodeficiency virus-Tat gene in lymphoid tissues of transgenic mice is associated with B-cell lymphoma.The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat gene, a potent transactivator of viral and cellular genes, has been proposed as a key agent in the pathogenesis of acquired immune deficiency syndrome related disorders, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In cultured cells, the HIV-1 Tat protein can induce the expression of the cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10, which are known to induce proliferation and differentiation of lymphoid cells. Such alterations in cytokine expression, together with a secondary genetic event, are thought to ultimately lead to oncogenic transformation. To address the influence of Tat on lymphoid development in the context of the whole organism, we produced several transgenic mouse lines that express the Tat gene under the control of an actin promoter. We show here that this promoter directs expression to a variety of sites, including spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. Approximately 25% to 30% of the Tat-transgenic population developed enlarged spleens within 1 year after birth. On histological examination, a significant number of spleens from Tat-transgenic mice exhibited malignant lymphoma of B-cell origin. IgG heavy chain rearrangement confirmed the clonal B-cell nature of these lymphoproliferations. In contrast, T-cell receptor genes exhibited a germline (unrearranged) structure. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of transgenic spleens revealed that mRNA encoding cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 was upregulated, suggesting a possible mechanism for the B-cell expansion in vivo

	10556549, nhancement of antibody responses by DNA immunization using expression vectors mediating efficient antigen secretion.The immune responses elicited in mice, after intradermal (i.d.) immunization with plasmids encoding secreted or intracellular forms of HIV-1 nef, HIV-1 tat or C. pneumoniae omp2 proteins, respectively, were compared. To mediate secretion of these proteins the genes were fused to a heterologous signal sequence from murine heavy chain IgG. The nef- and omp2-specific antibody responses were dramatically increased when mice were inoculated with the plasmid encoding the secreted form of these proteins. In contrast, HIV-1 tat comprising an internal strong nuclear targeting sequence could not be induced to secretion and subsequently no enhanced antibody response was observed. Slight improvement of the HIV-1 nef antibody response was achieved after co-inoculation with a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) expression vector. Further, nef-specific T-cell responses were induced after nef DNA injections, and were of Th1-like phenotype regardless of whether the nef protein was secreted or not. The system described in this study, using a plasmid vector with a strong heterologous signal sequence that mediate efficient antigen secretion in vivo, may have wide applicability for the induction of high antibody levels to normally non-secreted antigens

	10694813, nhibition of HIV-1 replication in chronically infected cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells by retrovirus-mediated antitat gene transfer.Among potential genetic targets for intervention in the HIV-1 life cycle, the tat gene product is a key target. We investigated the ability of an antitat gene to inhibit HIV-1 activation and replication in chronically infected promonocyte (U1) and T cell (ACH-2) lines in vitro. U1 and ACH-2 cells were transduced with an antitat gene expressing RNA with dual (polymeric Tat activation response element and antisense-tat) function that interferes with HIV-1 replication. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plus phorbol 12- myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced HIV-1 expression, as determined by reverse transcribed PCR and reverse transcriptase (RT) assays, was significantly inhibited in U1 and ACH-2 cells transduced with the antitat gene, compared with the cells transduced with control vector and untransduced cells. This resistance to TNF-alpha plus PMA-induced HIV-1 expression was demonstrated in antitat gene-transduced U1 and ACH-2 cells maintained in G418-free media for 5 months, suggesting that functional antitat gene may persist for many months in transduced cells and their progeny. Most importantly, we demonstrate that the antitat gene, when introduced into peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from patients with HIV-1 infection, inhibited TNF-alpha plus PMA-induced viral replication as determined by RT-PCR and RT activity. In addition, the antitat gene enhanced the survival of CD4+ T lymphocytes from such patients. These data suggest the feasibility of utilizing antitat gene therapy to block activation and replication of HIV-1 in latently infected monocytes and T- lymphocytes in vivo.

	10763745, eat-inducible vectors for use in gene therapy.The objectives of this study were to quantity and compare the activities of a minimal heat shock (HS) promoter and other promoters used in gene therapy applications, and to identify strategies to amplify the heat inducibility of therapeutic genes. Human tumour cells were transiently or stably transfected with the HS promoter driving expression of reporter genes. HS promoter activity was induced transiently, with maximum activity 16-24 h after HS, and was dependent on temperature. The activity of the minimal HS promoter was similar, after 42 degrees C HS for 1 h, to that of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. To determine if the HS promoter could be used to activate a second conditional promoter, cells were transiently transfected with vectors containing both the HS and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV1) promoters. When the IL-2 gene was placed downstream of the HIV1 promoter. IL-2 production was temperature-independent. The addition of the HIV tat gene downstream of the HS promoter caused IL-2 to be induced more than 3 fold after a single 42 degrees C HS. These data indicate that the minimal HS promoter, following activation by clinically attainable temperatures (&lt; or = 42 degrees C), can drive expression of therapeutic genes at levels comparable to the CMV promoter and be used in conjunction with a second conditional promoter to drive temperature-dependent, gene expression

	10915601, uSIV cells: a reporter cell line for the detection and quantitation of a single cycle of HIV and SIV replication.A single cycle of viral replication is the time required for a virus to enter the host cell, replicate its genome, and produce infectious progeny virions. The primate lentiviruses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), require on average 24 h to complete one cycle of replication. We have now developed and characterized a reporter assay system in CEMx174 cells for the quantitative measurement of HIV/SIV infection within a single replication cycle. The SIV(mac)239 LTR (-225 --&gt; +149) was cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene and this reporter plasmid is maintained in CEMx174 cells under stable selection. This cell line, designated LuSIV, is highly sensitive to infection by primary and laboratory strains of HIV/SIV, resulting in Tat-mediated expression of luciferase, which correlates with viral infectivity. Furthermore, manipulation of LuSIV cells for the detection of luciferase activity is easy to perform and requires a minimal amount of time as compared to current HIV/SIV detection systems. The LuSIV system is a powerful tool for the analysis of HIV/SIV infection that provides a unique assay system that can detect virus replication prior to 24 h and does not require virus to spread from cell to cell. Thus these cells can be used for the study of replication-deficient viruses and the high throughput screening of antivirals, or other inhibitors of infection

	10930666, utations occurring during serial passage of Japanese equine infectious anemia virus in primary horse macrophages.An attenuated equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), named V26, was previously obtained after 50 passages of the Japanese virulent strain V70 in primary macrophage culture. To clarify the differences between both viruses, their full-length sequences were determined. There were higher mutations in S2 (6.15% amino acid difference) and LTR (10.7% nucleotide difference). The presumed initiation codon of the S2 gene was absent from the sequence of V26. There was a large insertion within the long-terminal repeat (LTR) U3 hypervariable region of V26. In addition, there were minor mutations in gag (1.22% amino acid difference), pol (1.05% amino acid difference) and env (1. 65% amino acid difference) regions, but no mutation in tat region. No mutations were observed in the principal neutralizing domain in the gp90. Thus, the mutations in the S2 and LTR might be the major target sites of mutation in EIAV during serial passages in vitro

	10982343, haracterization of a major histocompatibility complex class II X-box-binding protein enhancing tat-induced transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat.The X-box element present within the promoter region of genes belonging to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) plays a pivotal role in the expression of class II molecules, since it contains the binding sites for several well-characterized transcription factors. We have analyzed a randomly selected compilation of viral genomes for the presence of elements homologous to the X box of the HLA-DRA gene. We found that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) shows the highest frequency of X-like box elements per 1,000 bases of genome. Within the HIV-1 genome, we found an X-like motif in the TAR region of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), a regulative region playing a pivotal role in Tat-induced HIV-1 transcription. The use of a decoy approach for nuclear proteins binding to this element, namely, XMAS (X-like motif activator sequence), performed by transfection of multiple copies of this sequence into cells carrying an integrated LTR-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct, suggests that this element binds to nuclear proteins that enhance Tat-induced transcription. In this report we have characterized two proteins, one binding to the XMAS motif and the other to the flanking regions of XMAS. Mobility shift assays performed on crude nuclear extracts or enriched fractions suggest that similar proteins bind to XMAS from HIV-1 and the X box of the HLA-DRA gene. Furthermore, a UV cross-linking assay suggests that one protein of 47 kDa, termed FAX (factor associated with XMAS)-1, binds to the XMAS of HIV-1. The other protein of 56 kDa was termed FAX-2. In a decoy ex vivo experiment, it was found that sequences recognizing both proteins are required to inhibit Tat-induced HIV-1 LTR-driven transcription. Taken together, the data reported in this paper suggest that XMAS and nearby sequences modulate Tat-induced HIV-1 transcription by binding to the X-box-binding proteins FAX-1 and FAX-2. The sequence homology between XMAS and X box is reflected in binding of a common protein, FAX-1, and similar functional roles in gene expression. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that transcription factors binding to the X box of the MHC class II genes enhance the transcription of HIV-1

	11021811, nhancement of chemical hepatocarcinogenesis by the HIV-1 tat gene.The human immunodeficiency virus-1 Tat protein is suspected to be involved in the neoplastic pathology arising in AIDS patients. tat-transgenic (TT) mice, which constitutively express Tat in the liver, develop liver cell dysplasia (LCD) that may represent a preneoplastic lesion. To test if TT mice are predisposed to liver carcinogenesis, we treated them with diethylnitrosamine, a hepatotropic carcinogen. Diethylnitrosamine-treated TT mice developed both preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions in the liver. They showed an enhancement of LCD and developed basophilic liver cell nodules (BLCN), hepatocellular adenomas (HA), and hepatocellular carcinomas (HC). Both preneoplastic (LCD and BLCN) and neoplastic (HA and HC) lesions were significantly more frequent in TT than in control mice: 29.7% versus 12.7% for LCD, 57.9% versus 23.3% for BLCN, 40.6% versus 10.0% for HA, and 50.0% versus 12.7% for HC. These results indicate that Tat expression in the liver predisposes to both initiation of hepatocarcinogenesis and to malignant progression of liver tumors. This study supports a role for Tat in enhancing the effect of endogenous and exogenous carcinogens in human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected patients, thereby contributing to tumorigenesis in the course of AIDS

	11033786, Effects of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 nef and tat genes on rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells]The regulatory genes nef and tat of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were transferred into the rat pheochromocytoma cells (line PC12) under the control of the eukaryotic promoters. Proliferative activity of the PC12 cells transfected with the tat HIV-1 gene was substantially increased as compared to the control. Conversely, the nef gene introduced into the cultivated PC12 cell caused inhibition of their proliferative activity and formation of cell agglomerates resembling in morphology the multinuclear syncytial cells. Thus, our results suggest that the tat gene activates proliferation of the cultivated PC12 cells, whereas the nef gene inhibits proliferation of the same cells. We have obtained for the first time a direct indication for the possible role of the nef gene in formation of multinuclear T-lymphocyte and macrophage syncytium in HIV-1-infected patients. The HIV-1 nef and tat genes had no significant effect on the neuronal differentiation of the PC12 cells induced by the nerve growth factor (NGF)

	11228375, NA vaccination in mice using HIV-1 nef, rev and tat genes in self-replicating pBN-vector.The immunogenicity of a self-replicating DNA-vector containing HIV-1 nef gene (pBN-Nef) was characterized using various DNA delivery methods. In addition, gene gun immunisation was used for assessing immunogenicity of two other HIV-1 genes (rev and tat) given in the same vector. The pBN-Nef was the most immunogenic raising both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in mice; these responses lasted for up to six months. The pBN-Nef vector was immunogenic also when given intramuscularly or intradermally. The pBN-Rev construct did not elicit humoral responses but did elicit proliferative as well as CTL-response against the corresponding protein. The pBN-Tat was a poor immunogen in all respects. The antibodies elicited with various DNA delivery methods belonged to different antibody subclasses; however, two main epitopes in Nef were frequently recognized by all of them

	11238879, epair of a Rev-minus human immunodeficiency virus type 1 mutant by activation of a cryptic splice site.We isolated a revertant virus after prolonged culturing of a replication-impaired human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) mutant of which the Rev open reading frame was inactivated by mutation of the AUG translation initiation codon. Sequencing of the tat-rev region of this revertant virus identified a second-site mutation in tat that restored virus replication in the mutant background. This mutation activated a cryptic 5' splice site (ss) that, when used in conjunction with the regular HIV 3' ss #5, fuses the tat and rev reading frames to encode a novel T-Rev fusion protein that rescues Rev function. We also demonstrate an alternative route to indirectly activate this cryptic 5' ss by mutational inactivation of an adjacent exon splicing silencer element

Two phase I clinical trials are underway to test the safety and feasibility of the approach with the anti-tat ribozyme in human subjects

	11311202, mplification of extracellular matrix and oncogenes in tat-transfected human salivary gland cell lines with expression of laminin, fibronectin, collagens I, III, IV, c-myc and p53.Considerable progress has been made in the transfer of foreign genes into salivary glands in vivo using adenovirus vectors in rats. In an attempt to avoid the transient expression inherent, when using these vectors, retroviral vectors and human cell lines where used here in attempt to develop an in vitro model of HIV-associated salivary gland disease. The HIV-1-tat protein is increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of the AIDS through altering the expression of strategic cellular genes. The purpose of this study was to transfect human salivary gland (HSG) cell lines in vitro, with the pHIV-1/LTR-tat plasmid, and examine the effect of tat on expression of matrix and basement membrane genes known to be important in the pathogenesis of salivary gland disease. HSG cells were transfected with HIV-1-tat plasmid by the lipofection method. Transfection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot, which verified that tat-specific DNA was present. Tat-mRNA was analysed by Northern blotting and quantified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to demonstrate its expression. Numerous clones were found to contain integrated tat DNA sequences and analysis of mRNA showed stable expression of tat-specific RNA. Further analysis of mRNA expression for various marker proteins important in HIV pathogenesis showed that the HSG cell line transfected with HIV-1-tat, was associated with significant induction of mRNA expression for extracellular matrix protein. Tat-amplified transcription of the major basement membrane protein laminin, as well as of fibronectin, collagen I and III, and c-myc oncogene was demonstrated. Conversely, expression of p53 suppressor gene mRNA was reduced. Post-transfection expression of collagen IV was erratic and inconclusive. It was concluded that the presence of HIV-tat in this in vitro model of salivary ductal epithelial cell model alters the mRNA expression of several matrix, basement membrane and oncoproteins known to be involved in HIV pathogenesis. These cell lines provide a useful system for studying the role of tat in the immunopathogenesis of HIV-associated salivary gland disease

	11312017, lasmid DNA encoding caprine interferon gamma inhibits antibody response to caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV) surface protein encoded by a co-administered plasmid expressing CAEV env and tat genes.This study characterized immune responses of Saanen goats co-immunized with pUC18 based plasmids expressing caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV) rev-env (pENV) or tat-rev-env (pTAT-ENV) and a second plasmid encoding caprine interferon gamma (IFNgamma). A previous study reported that immunization with pENV or pTAT-ENV induces IgG2 biased antibody responses to plasmid encoded CAEV surface envelope protein (SU). We show here that regional lymph nodes (LN) of pENV and pTAT-ENV immunized goats contain a dominant subset of SU activated IFNgamma+ Th1 lymphocytes. Co-immunization with pENV or pTAT-ENV and a caprine IFNgamma cDNA expression plasmid (pcIFNgamma) did not potentiate activation of SU responsive Th1 lymphocytes. However, the antibody response to SU encoded by pTAT-ENV was inhibited by co-immunization with pcIFNgamma. Results indicate that synergistic effects of CAEV Tat and IFNgamma suppress the primary adaptive B cell response to plasmid encoded SU

	11352667, nteractions of single and combined human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) DNA vaccines.DNA immunization permits evaluation of possible antagonistic or synergistic effects between the encoded components. The protein expression capacity in vitro was related to the immunogenicity in vivo of plasmids encoding the HIV-1 regulatory genes tat rev, and nef. Neither Tat nor Rev expression was influenced by co-expression in vitro of all three proteins, while Nef expression was slightly inhibited. With the combination of genes, the T-cellular responses of mice against Rev and Nef were inhibited compared with those when single gene immunization was used. No interference was detected for the Tat T-cell response. Thus, co-immunization with certain genes may result in inhibition of specific immune responses

	11365600, usion inhibitors, T-20; chemokine variants; tat and interferon antibodies: Gallo describes three new treatment approaches.Virologist Robert Gallo described three new antiretroviral treatment approaches for HIV at the 12th World AIDS Conference. The three treatments, fusion inhibitors, chemokines, and alpha and tat interferon antibodies, differ substantially from the treatments now used. The process of cell fusion may offer many potential targets for fusion inhibitors, and clinical trials have shown that viral load drops faster with fusion inhibitors than with currently approved regimens. T-20 is one of the fusion inhibitors now under development by Trimeris, Inc. Chemokines, which interact with receptors CCR5 and CXCR4, are believed to have antiretroviral effects. However, chemokines' normal functioning may have some problematic effects. Developing variants of these chemokines may solve some of these problems by allowing the chemokines to have antiretroviral effects, without the normal functioning of chemokines. Antibodies against tat and alpha interferon may also be effective in HIV treatment. HIV kills some T-cells directly, but the larger decline in the number of T-cells is thought to be associated with an overproduction of alpha interferon and tat cells. Antibodies against the alpha interferon and tat cells may restore T-cell reproduction to normal levels

	11429117, haracterization of HIV type 1 tat sequences associated with perinatal transmission.Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) tat exon I sequences were analyzed from six mother-infant pairs after perinatal transmission. The tat open reading frame was maintained in 140 of the 154 clones analyzed, with a 90.9% frequency of intact tat open reading frames. In addition, a low degree of heterogeneity was observed in tat sequences within mothers, within infants, and between epidemiologically linked mother-infant pairs. However, the distances of tat sequences between epidemiologically unlinked individuals were greater than in epidemiologically linked mother-infant pairs. The infant sequences showed amino acid sequence patterns similar to those present in their respective mothers. The functional domains required for Tat function, including amino-terminal, cysteine-rich, core and basic regions, which constitute domains for activation and RNA binding, were highly conserved in most of the sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of 154 mother-infant tat sequences showed that they formed distinct clusters for each mother-infant pair and grouped with subtype B sequence. These findings suggest that an intact and functional tat gene is conserved in HIV-1 mother-infant isolates that are involved in perinatal transmission

	11438838, V40-derived vectors provide effective transgene expression and inhibition of HIV-1 using constitutive, conditional,and pol III promoters.Vectors based on recombinant SV40 viruses (rSV40) are highly effective in delivering transgene expression driven by constitutive promoters. We tested here whether these vectors could be used with conditional promoters and promoters using RNA polymerase III transcription, with inhibition of HIV-1 by Tat activation response (TAR) decoys as a functional measure of effective transgene delivery and activity. TAR decoys inhibit HIV-1 Tat, a trans-activator of HIV-1 transcription. Tat acts early in the viral replicative cycle and is essential for efficient viral replication. We evaluated rSV40 gene delivery using two different inhibitors of Tat. One was a dual function polyTAR gene encoding 25 sequential TAR elements (TAR(25)), plus an antisense tat, driven either by HIV-1 long terminal repeat (HIV-LTR) as a conditional promoter, or by cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter (CMV-IEP) as a constitutive promoter. The other inhibitor was a single TAR decoy, driven by the U6 small nuclear RNA promoter (U6-P). These decoys were delivered to unselected cells in two different human T lymphocyte lines and to unstimulated primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc). Gene delivery was confirmed by PCR, and expression by RT-PCR. By in situ hybridization analysis, &gt;95% of cells were transduced. These transgene constructs protected all cell types tested from HIV-1, as measured by syncytia formation and p24 antigen release. Somewhat better inhibition of HIV-1 replication was achieved with HIV-1 long terminal repeat (HIV-1 LTR) as a conditional promoter than with the constitutive CMV-IEP. The U6-P was also very effective, driving a TAR(1) transcript. Cell viability was not detectably affected by TAR decoy expression. Thus, rSV40 vectors effectively deliver HIV-1-inhibitory RNAs using either constitutive or conditional pol II promoters, or using a pol III promoter. The versatility of this gene delivery system may prove to be useful in anti-HIV-1 therapeutics

	11533184, dentification of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 subtype C Gag-, Tat-, Rev-, and Nef-specific elispot-based cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses for AIDS vaccine design.The most severe human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) epidemic is occurring in southern Africa. It is caused by HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C). In this study we present the identification and analysis of cumulative cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses in the southern African country of Botswana. CTLs were shown to be an important component of the immune response to control HIV-1 infection. The definition of optimal and dominant epitopes across the HIV-1C genome that are targeted by CTL is critical for vaccine design. The characteristics of the predominant virus that causes the HIV-1 epidemic in a certain geographic area and also the genetic background of the population, through the distribution of common HLA class I alleles, might impact dominant CTL responses in the vaccinee and in the general population. The enzyme-linked immunospot (Elispot) gamma interferon assay has recently been shown to be a reliable tool to map optimal CTL epitopes, correlating well with other methods, such as intracellular staining, tetramer staining, and the classical chromium release assay. Using Elispot with overlapping synthetic peptides across Gag, Tat, Rev, and Nef, we analyzed HIV-1C-specific CTL responses of HIV-1-infected blood donors. Profiles of cumulative Elispot-based CTL responses combined with diversity and sequence consensus data provide an additional characterization of immunodominant regions across the HIV-1C genome. Results of the study suggest that the construction of a poly-epitope subtype-specific HIV-1 vaccine that includes multiple copies of immunodominant CTL epitopes across the viral genome, derived from predominant HIV-1 viruses, might be a logical approach to the design of a vaccine against AIDS

	11679927, uman immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients receiving prolonged highly active antiretroviral therapy.The levels of early spliced mRNA and genomic RNA of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 14 patients who were receiving highly active combination antiretroviral therapy for &gt; or =116 weeks were determined. The level of viral genomic RNA was below the level of detection in the plasma of these patients (&lt;50 copies/mL), but cell-associated viral tat, rev, and nef mRNA were detected in 86% (12 of 14) of the patients. Cell-associated viral genomic RNA was detected in 57% (8 of 14) of the patients. Early viral spliced mRNA was detected in the PBMC of all patients who had positive results of testing for HIV-1 genomic RNA, and the level of viral genomic RNA in these patients was 34-2214 copies per 10(6) cells

	11765920, ffect of deletion and the site of insertion in double copy anti-tat retroviral vectors: viral titres and production of anti-tat mRNA.In attempts to further develop murine leukemia virus (MLV) based retroviral vectors for gene therapy, we investigated vector production and antisense expression from retroviral constructs with U3 deletions or insertions. Promoter elements in the U3 region of the 3' LTR of the vector pLXSN were deleted and replaced with DNA encoding the HIV anti-tat gene under control of the tRNAmet promoter to produce a double copy self inactivating vector (DC-SIN). DC-SIN constructs were compared to vectors containing the anti-tat cassette inserted at 5 different sites of the U3 region (DC-insertions). Titres of DC-SIN and DC-insertion vectors were similar but approximately 10 fold lower than parental pLXSN. Cells transduced with DC-SIN and DC-insertion vectors all expressed anti-tat mRNA. Transcripts from the MLV-LTR were detected in cells transduced with DC-insertion but not DC-SIN vectors or a vector with the anti-tat cassette between CAAT and TATA boxes of the promoter, indicating inactivation of the viral promoter in the latter vectors. Cells transduced with constructs of either design showed comparable efficacy of protection against HIV challenge. Thus, no U3 insertion site was preferred for virus production. Insertion of a tRNA promoter between CAAT and TATA boxes and the DC-SIN design which would not introduce an active RNA pol II promoter into the genome are attractive for further development of safe gene therapy agents

	11776437,  simple screening system for anti-HIV drugs: syncytium formation assay using T-cell line tropic and macrophage tropic HIV env expressing cell lines--establishment and validation.The first step in cellular entry of HIV involves binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein complex (gp120/gp41) to specific receptor molecules on the target cells. The cell-cell fusion (syncytium formation) between env expressing cells and CD4+ cells mimics the viral infection of the host cells. To search for anti-HIV substances preventing this process, we constructed the recombinant cell lines, HeLa/CD4/Lac-Z and HeLa/T-env/Tat for T-cell tropic (HIV-1(NL4-3)) system, and HOS/CD4/CCR5/Lac-Z and HeLa/M-env/Tat for macrophage tropic (HIV-1(SF162)) system. When each pair of cells were co-incubated for 20 hours, the multinuclear giant cells (syncytia) were formed and beta-galactosidase was expressed. These systems are less biohazardous because no infectious virus particles are used. Their validity in screening for anti-HIV substances which inhibit syncytium formation was confirmed using various known HIV entry inhibitors

	11839148, haracterization of the South African HIV type 1 subtype C complete 5' long terminal repeat, nef, and regulatory genes.Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C has become the major etiological agent in the global and especially African epidemic. To gain better understanding of the genetic diversity and rapid transmission of HIV-1 subtype C, we have characterized the complete 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) region along with the regulatory genes tat and rev as well as the accessory gene nef of 14 South African HIV-1 subtype C isolates. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a subtype C 5' LTR cluster, as well as subclustering of our nef sequences with various subtype C strains separate from the India and China subclusters. At least 3 NF-kappaB sites were present in the 5' LTR of most isolates and 13 isolates had the subtype C-specific Rev truncation. Some length variation in exon 2 and the absence of a critical cysteine were found in Tat. Residue variation in the myristoylation signal and motifs involved in CD4 and MHC-I downregulation was recorded in our nef gene sequences

	12163269,  novel chimeric Rev, Tat, and Nef (Retanef) antigen as a component of an SIV/HIV vaccine.The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) regulatory proteins Rev, Tat, and Nef are expressed at early time post-infection and represent attractive targets to be included in a vaccine candidate for AIDS. However, the putative immunosuppressive activities of some of these proteins may limit their immunogenicity. To circumvent these issues, a novel chimeric polyprotein vaccine candidate (Retanef), comprising genetically modified and re-assorted rev, tat, and nef open reading frames of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), was constructed and optimized for its expression in mammalian cells. Retanef encodes a protein of approximately 55 kDa localized primarily in the cytoplasm of transfected cells. The Retanef gene expressed in context of an eucaryotic expression vector (DNA-SIV-Retanef) or cloned into a highly attenuated poxvirus-based NYVAC vector (NYVAC-SIV-Retanef) was used to immunize either naive rhesus macaques or macaques chronically infected with SIVmac251 undergoing anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Three immunizations of naive macaques with DNA-SIV-Retanef followed by a single NYVAC-SIV-Retanef boost induced a response to the Mamu-A(*)01-restricted Tat epitope (Tat_SL8, TTPESANL) demonstrated by staining with a specific tetramer and by direct cytolytic activity assays, as well as responses to Rev, Tat and Nef proteins demonstrated by ELISPOT assays using overlapping peptide pools encompassing the entire proteins. Immunization of infected macaques with either DNA-SIV-Retanef or NYVAC-SIV-Retanef expanded the frequency of Tat-specific tetramer-staining cells by two- to seven-fold. No adverse effects were observed in either naive or SIV-infected rhesus macaques. Thus, an analogous HIV-1-based chimeric vaccine may represent useful component of an HIV-1 vaccine

	12212929, esidual cell-associated unspliced HIV-1 RNA in peripheral blood of patients on potent antiretroviral therapy represents intracellular transcripts.Unspliced HIV-RNA (HIV-UsRNA) associated with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) persists in patients on potent antiretroviral therapy even in the absence of detectable plasma HIV-RNA. To further characterize such residual HIV-RNA, cell-associated virion-encapsidated HIV and intracellular unspliced HIV-RNA were differentiated and monitored using a novel highly sensitive method. In addition, expression of HIV-mRNA encoding tat and rev was assessed. PBMCs of patients with unsuppressed plasma viraemia harboured an extracellular fraction of HIV-UsRNA, which correlated highly with intracellular HIV-RNA levels. Thus, extracellular PBMC-associated HIV-RNA may, to a significant extent, reflect nascent virions attached to productively infected cells. Upon treatment with potent antiretroviral therapy resulting in plasma viraemia &lt;50 copies/ml, expression of cell-associated viral particles was hardly discernible in PBMCs but transcription of unspliced HIV-RNA persisted. Given the virtual absence of rev-mRNA, translation of residual HIV-UsRNA was probably precluded by retention of these transcripts in the nucleus. As shown by limiting dilution analysis, HIV-1 infected cells with such a repressed viral transcription pattern were observed at high frequencies in PBMC from untreated patients

	12350353, uman immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcription is stimulated by tat from other lentiviruses.The tat gene is required by HIV-1 for efficient reverse transcription and this function of Tat can be distinguished from its role in transcription by RNA polymerase II using tat point mutations that abrogate each function independently. The mechanism of Tat's role in reverse transcription, however, is not known, nor is it known whether this role is conserved among trans-activating factors in other retroviruses. Here we examine the abilities of heterologous viral trans-activating proteins from jembrana disease virus (jTat), HIV-2 (Tat2), and equine infectious anemia virus (eTat) to substitute for HIV-1 Tat (Tat1) and restore reverse transcription in HIV-1 carrying an inactivated tat gene. Natural endogenous reverse transcription assays showed that trans-activators from some retroviruses (Tat2 and jTat, but not eTat) could substitute for Tat1 in complementation of HIV-1 reverse transcription. Finally, we show that Y47 is critical for Tat1 to function in reverse transcription, but not HIV-1 gene expression. We mutated the homologous position in jTat to H62Y and found it did not improve its ability to stimulate reverse transcription, but an H62A mutation did inhibit jTat complementation. These data highlight the finding that the role of Tat in reverse transcription is not related to trans-activation and demonstrate that other tat genes conserve this function

	12396604, esign and in vivo immunogenicity of a polyvalent vaccine based on SIVmac regulatory genes.Most vaccine modalities for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) tested for immunogenicity and efficacy in the SIVmac (simian immunodeficiency virus) macaque model do not include the viral regulatory proteins. Because viral regulatory proteins are expressed early during the virus life cycle and represent an additional source of antigens, their inclusion as a vaccine component may increase the overall virus-specific immune response in vaccinees. However, at least two of the early proteins, Tat and Nef, may be immunosuppressive, limiting their usefulness as components of an SIV vaccine. We have constructed a polyvalent chimeric protein in which the open reading frames for Tat and Nef have been reassorted and the nuclear localization sequence for Tat and Rev and the myristoylation site for Nef have been removed. The resulting DNA plasmid (pDNA-SIV-Retanef) (pDNA-SIV-RTN) encodes a protein of 55 kDa (Retanef) that localizes at the steady state in the cytoplasma of transfected cells. Both the DNA-SIV-RTN and the highly attenuated recombinant poxvirus vector NYVAC-SIV-RTN were demonstrated to be immunogenic in SIVmac251-infected macaques treated with ART as well as in naive macaques. An equivalent strategy may be used for the generation of polyvalent antigens encoding the regulatory proteins in a HIV-1 vaccine candidate

	12396627, nducible expression of the deltaNGFr/F12Nef fusion protein as a new tool for anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gene therapy.Expression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Nef triple mutant F12Nef strongly inhibits HIV-1 replication. We exploited such a unique feature in a novel anti-HIV-1 gene therapy design by constructing an HIV-1 Tat-defective lentivirus vector expressing the product of fusion between the low-affinity human nerve growth factor receptor truncated in its intracytoplasmic domain (deltaNGFr, NH(2) moiety), and F12Nef (COOH moiety), under the control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeats. In this manner, both the selection marker (deltaNGFr) and the anti-HIV-1 effector are comprised in the same fusion protein, the expression of which is targetable by HIV-1 infection. Such a vector was proved to transduce human cells efficiently and, on HIV-1 infection, it expressed high levels of the fusion protein. In addition, strong antiviral activity of the deltaNGFr/F12Nef-expressing vector was demonstrated in cell lines as well as in primary cell cultures challenged with T- or M-tropic HIV-1 isolates. Thus, the HIV-1-targetable expression of the deltaNGFr/F12Nef fusion protein represents a novel and powerful tool for an effective anti-HIV-1 gene therapy strategy

	12569786, Identification and characterization of HIV-1 subtype D strain in China]OBJECTIVE: Through sequence analysis of HIV-1 gag, tat and env regions, the subtype D HIV-1 had been identified appering in China. METHODS: The blood was collected from HIV-1 infected individual (SC9 712) in Sichuan Province. The peripheral blod mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from the blood by ficoll and the genomic DNA was extracted. The gag gene, the C2-V3 of the env gene and the first exon of tat gene were amplified by nested-PCR and sequenced directly. RESULTS: The genetic distance respectively is 7.56% in tat gene between SC9 712 and UG274A, 9.59% and 9.94% in gag gene between SC9 712 and K31 and VI203, 13.86% in env gene between SC9 712 and MAL. On the phylogenetic tree the SC9 712 HIV-1 strain clustered with the Africa subtype D strains UG274A, K31, VI203 and MAL. The above data demonstrated that SC9 712 was subtype D HIV-1 strain. Epidemiological data showed that SC9 712 virus was from a person who had worked in Africa. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the person who came back from Africa had transmitted the subtype D of HIV-1 from Africa to China

	12573497, ucleotide sequence analysis of the accessory genes of HIV-1 group O isolates.Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 group O strains have been described as highly divergent, compared with the majority of the viruses classified in group M. To study the diversity and genetic characteristics of group O, we have sequenced the accessory genes of 7 isolates. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences for Vif, Vpr, Tat, Vpu, and Rev indicate that most of the functional domains of these proteins, as described for group M viruses, are highly conserved and retained among all the group O strains we have characterized. The only difference concerns the Vif phosphorylation sites, which are absent in all of the group O isolated we have sequence with the exception of two isolates in which only one phosphorylation site was conserved. These sites, present in nearly all of the group M isolates, play a critical role in the regulation of viral replication and infectivity. As described for group M isolates, the vpu gene is the one with the highest diversity among group O viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences suggests that group O viruses could be differentiated into at least four different clusters

	12869996, Construction and analysis of activity of an HIV-1/bovine immunodeficiency virus chimeric clone cDNA]OBJECTIVE: Chimeric human/bovine immunodeficiency virus (HBIV) cDNA was constructed by replacing HIV tat and LTR with bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) tat and LTR to study the activity of BIV tat and LTR in the chimerae. METHODS: The target fragments of BIV tat, LTR and HIV gag, pol, env were respectively amplified by using PCR and sequentially inserted into pBluescript SK(+) vector. The chimeric clone was transfected into human MT4 cells. The transcript and gene expression of the HBIV chimeric virus were detected by using RT-PCR and a reverse transcriptase assay, respectively. RESULTS: BIV tat mRNA and HIV gag mRNA were detected. The reverse transcriptase activity of the chimeric virus was analyzed in the fluctuation curve. CONCLUSIONS: In chimeric HBIV cDNA transfected MT?4 cells, BIV tat and HIV gag were transcripted. The reverse transcriptase of the chimeric virus had biological activity. These data suggest that in MT4 cells, BIV LTR had promoter activity and BIV tat had the function of transactivation in the chimeric virus. The study of the chimeric virus with infectivity is in progress

	12870121, ack of detectable human immunodeficiency virus type 1 superinfection during 1072 person-years of observation.We examined consecutive protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) sequences from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1-infected individuals, to distinguish changes resulting from sequence evolution due to possible superinfection. Between July 1997 and December 2001, &gt;/=2 PR and RT samples from 718 persons were sequenced at Stanford University Hospital. Thirty-seven persons had highly divergent sequence pairs characterized by a nucleotide distance of &gt;4.5% in PR or &gt;3.0% in RT. In 16 of 37 sequence pairs, divergence resulted from the loss of mutations during a treatment interruption or from the gain of mutations with reinstitution of treatment. tat and/or gag sequencing of HIV-1 from cryopreserved plasma samples could be performed on 15 of the 21 divergent isolate pairs from persons without a treatment interruption. The sequences of these genes, unaffected by selective drug pressure, were monophyletic. Although HIV-1 PR and RT genes from treated persons may become highly divergent, these changes usually are the result of sequence evolution, rather than superinfection

	14581533, nhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication in primary macrophages by using Tat- or CCR5-specific small interfering RNAs expressed from a lentivirus vector.Although several groups have demonstrated that RNA interference, induced by transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes, can protect cells against a viral challenge in culture, this protection is transient. Here, we describe lentivirus expression vectors that can stably express siRNAs at levels sufficient to block virus replication. We have used these vectors to stably express siRNAs specific for the essential human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat transcription factor or specific for a cellular coreceptor, CCR5, that is required for infection by the majority of primary HIV-1 isolates. These lentivirus vectors are shown to protect cells, including primary macrophages, against HIV-1 infection in culture by inducing selective degradation of their target mRNA species. These data suggest that it should be possible to block the expression of specific viral or cellular genes in vivo by using viral vectors to stably express the appropriate siRNAs

	14595379, he cationic region from HIV tat enhances the cell-surface expression of epitope/MHC class I complexes.The potential of genetic immunization has been acknowledged for almost a decade, but disappointing immunogenicity in humans has delayed its introduction into the clinical arena. To try to increase the potency of genetic immunization, we and others have evaluated 'translocatory' proteins, which are thought to exit living cells by an uncharacterized pathway, and enter neighboring cells in an energy-independent manner. Several laboratories, including our own, have begun to question these remarkable properties. Our previous studies showed that the ability of an epitope to induce major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I restricted CD8(+) T cells was, indeed, enhanced by its being attached to the proposed translocatory sequence of the HIV-1 tat protein. However, we found little evidence that the increased immunogenicity resulted from transfer of the fusion peptide between living cells, and we proposed that it resulted instead from an increased epitope/MHC expression on the surface of transfected cells. Here, we directly test this hypothesis. We show that cells cotransfected with plasmids encoding an epitope, and the relevant MHC class I allele, can stimulate epitope-specific T cells, and that attachment of the epitope to a putative translocatory sequence - which we term herein an 'integral cationic region' (ICR) - leads to a marked increase in stimulatory activity. This elevated stimulatory capacity does not result from a nonspecific increase in MHC class I expression. We use a high-affinity T-cell receptor (TcR) specific for the epitope/MHC combination to quantitate directly the cell-surface expression of the immunogenic complex, and we show that the attachment of the tat ICR to an epitope results in a substantial enhancement of its cell-surface presentation. These data suggest an alternative explanation for the immune enhancement seen with ICRs

	14689754, ene therapy for human immunodeficiency virus infection in the humanized SCID mouse model.BACKGROUND: The humanized SCID mouse model is an attractive tool for testing gene therapy to combat human immunodeficiency virus infection in vivo. OBJECTIVES: To devise a more specific gene therapy directed against HIV, replacing the formerly used interferon with either soluble CD4 molecule immunoadhesin (sCD4-IgG) and/or anti-gp41 monoclonal antibody (2F5), or HIV-negative transdominants genes (Tat, Rev). METHODS: Human monocytoid cell line (U937) was transfected with IFN alpha, beta or gamma genes. 3T3 murine fibroblastic cell line was transfected with sCD4-IgG or 2F5, or both genes, and a human T4 cell line (CEM) was grafted to SCID mice. Negative transdominant genes (Tat, Rev or both) were also transduced in CEM T cell line. Animals were then challenged with HIV-1, Viral load was followed. RESULTS: IFN alpha or beta were potent anti-HIV, reducing viral load in vivo and inhibiting reverse transcriptase activity in human-removed cells from animals. sCD4-IgG immunoadhesin and gp41 monoclonal antibody resulted in a dramatic reduction of HIV-1 cellular and plasmatic viral load in humanized SCID mice. The simultaneous introduction of negative Tat and Rev genes resulted in a synergistic inhibition of HIV-1 replication in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the marked reduction of HIV-1 propagation by IFN genes or by negative Tat and Rev transdominants, the gene therapy using soluble CD4 immunoadhesin or anti-gp41 was a more efficient preventive treatment against HIV infection

	15018708, pliced human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA is reverse transcribed into cDNA within infected cells.Both the full-length and spliced RNA species of HIV-1 possess the necessary cis-acting elements including the primer binding site (PBS), the polypurine tract (PPT), as well as the 5' R and 3' R regions that are needed for their conversion to double-stranded cDNA through reverse transcription. Since measurable amounts of spliced viral RNA molecules can be detected within virus particles, we have examined the potential for reverse transcription of such virion-associated spliced viral RNA upon infection of permissive cells. Analysis of viral cDNA species by PCR and DNA sequencing not only led to the identification of viral DNA molecules that were reverse transcribed from full-length viral RNA, but also DNA molecules that displayed the same nucleotide sequences as those found in spliced viral RNA, except that the former harbored the complete long terminal repeats (LTR), a feature that distinguishes proviral DNA from viral genomic RNA. Further studies revealed various types of cDNA species that resemble the spliced viral RNA encoding each of the env, tat, rev, or nef genes, of which the nef cDNA represents the majority. Therefore, spliced HIV-1 RNA molecules must have been reverse transcribed along with full-length viral RNA during infection

	15073028, IV-1 Tat enhances Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infectivity.The high frequency of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) in immunodeficiency states, particularly in patients with AIDS, has been attributed to increased replication of KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a necessary cofactor for KS development. However, experimental KSHV infection of endothelial lineage cells that compose KS lesions has been difficult even in the absence of immune cells. Here we show that HIV-1 Tat protein can directly promote KSHV transmission. Full-length HIV-1 Tat and a 13-amino-acid peptide corresponding to the basic region of Tat specifically enhances the entry of KSHV into endothelial and other cells, presenting evidence for an active role of HIV-1 in the development of KSHV-associated diseases. These results can explain why AIDS-KS is more frequent and clinically more aggressive than KS in other immunodeficiency states

	15280222, apping sites of positive selection and amino acid diversification in the HIV genome: an alternative approach to vaccine design?A safe and effective HIV-1 vaccine is urgently needed to control the worldwide AIDS epidemic. Traditional methods of vaccine development have been frustratingly slow, and it is becoming increasingly apparent that radical new approaches may be required. Computational and mathematical approaches, combined with evolutionary reasoning, may provide new insights for the design of an efficacious AIDS vaccine. Here, we used codon-based substitution models and maximum-likelihood (ML) methods to identify positively selected sites that are likely to be involved in the immune control of HIV-1. Analysis of subtypes B and C revealed widespread adaptive evolution. Positively selected amino acids were detected in all nine HIV-1 proteins, including Env. Of particular interest was the high level of positive selection within the C-terminal regions of the immediate-early regulatory proteins, Tat and Rev. Many of the amino acid replacements were associated with the emergence of novel (or alternative) myristylation and casein kinase II (CKII) phosphorylation sites. The impact of these changes on the conformation and antigenicity of Tat and Rev remains to be established. In rhesus macaques, a single CTL-associated amino substitution in Tat has been linked to escape from acute SIV infection. Understanding the relationship between host-driven positive selection and antigenic variation may lead to the development of novel vaccine strategies that preempt the escape process

	15545352, eterminants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 escape from the primary CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte response.CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play an important role in containment of virus replication in primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV's ability to mutate to escape from CTL pressure is increasingly recognized; but comprehensive studies of escape from the CD8 T cell response in primary HIV infection are currently lacking. Here, we have fully characterized the primary CTL response to autologous virus Env, Gag, and Tat proteins in three patients, and investigated the extent, kinetics, and mechanisms of viral escape from epitope-specific components of the response. In all three individuals, we observed variation beginning within weeks of infection at epitope-containing sites in the viral quasispecies, which conferred escape by mechanisms including altered peptide presentation/recognition and altered antigen processing. The number of epitope-containing regions exhibiting evidence of early CTL escape ranged from 1 out of 21 in a subject who controlled viral replication effectively to 5 out of 7 in a subject who did not. Evaluation of the extent and kinetics of HIV-1 escape from &gt;40 different epitope-specific CD8 T cell responses enabled analysis of factors determining escape and suggested that escape is restricted by costs to intrinsic viral fitness and by broad, codominant distribution of CTL-mediated pressure on viral replication

	15629359, unctionally-inactive and immunogenic Tat, Rev and Nef DNA vaccines derived from sub-Saharan subtype C human immunodeficiency virus type 1 consensus sequences.The efficacy of cellular immune responses elicited by HIV vaccines is dependent on their strength, durability and antigenic breadth. The regulatory proteins are abundantly expressed early in the viral life cycle and CTL recognition may bring about early killing of infected cells. We synthesised DNA vaccine constructs that encode consensus HIV-1 subtype C Tat, Rev and Nef proteins. Proteins carrying inactivating mutations were tested for functional activity and highly expressing, inactive Tat, Rev and Nef mutants were identified and their reading frames fused into a TatRevNef cassette. Single- and polygene Tat, Rev and/or Nef constructs were immunogenic in BALB/c mice. These constructs may serve to increase the antigenic breadth for an HIV-1 vaccine that is relevant for sub-Saharan Africa

	15655805, ong-term survival and concomitant gene expression of ribozyme-transduced CD4+ T-lymphocytes in HIV-infected patients.BACKGROUND: An anti-HIV-1 tat ribozyme, termed Rz2, has been shown to inhibit HIV-1 infection/replication and to decrease HIV-1-induced pathogenicity in T-lymphocyte cell lines and normal peripheral blood T-lymphocytes. We report here the results of a phase I gene transfer clinical trial using Rz2. METHODS: Apheresis was used to obtain a peripheral blood cell population from each of four HIV-negative donors. After enrichment for CD4+ T-lymphocytes, ex vivo expansion and genetic manipulation (approximately equal aliquots of the cells were transduced with the ribozyme-containing (RRz2) and the control (LNL6) retroviral vector), these cells were infused into the corresponding HIV-1-positive twin recipient. Marking was assessed over an initial 24-week period and in total over an approximate 4-year period. RESULTS: The gene transfer procedure was shown to be safe, and technically feasible. Both RRz2- and LNL6-gene-containing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were detected at all time points examined to 4 years. There was concomitant gene construct expression in the absence of the need for ex vivo peripheral blood cell stimulation and there was no evidence of immune elimination of the neoR T-lymphocytes nor of silencing of the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat. CONCLUSIONS: The proof of principle results reported here demonstrate safety and feasibility of this type of gene transfer approach. While not specifically tested, T-lymphocytes containing an anti-HIV gene construct may impact on HIV-1 viral load and CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, potentially representing a new therapeutic modality for HIV-1 infection

	15916041, he role of the Tat gene in the pathogenesis of HIV infection.The human immunodeficiency virus Tat regulatory protein is essential for virus replication and for the efficient transcription of HIV-1 provirus, and in the pathogenesis of AIDS. The role of the tat gene was investigated in 300 samples. It was found that 71.7% were subtype CRF_01AE, 9.3% were subtype B, while 11.7 and 7.3% of them were cross-reactive and non-typeable, respectively. Moreover the results from peptide ELISA also showed that a low CD4 cell count was related to a low anti-Tat antibody (p &lt; 0.05), which may be due to the progression of HIV-1, which can be found predominantly in AIDS patients. The results of nested PCR showed that the second Tat exon might also play a role in T-cell activation. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to measure HIV-1 mRNA expression in PBMC. RT-PCR negative results were found mostly in the asymptomatic HIV-seropositive group (88%). HIV-1 mRNA expression was found to correlate with current immunologic status. The differences in Tat protein sequences from DNA sequencing between the patients who had anti-Tat antibody positive and anti-Tat antibody negative, were not significant (p &gt; 0.05). These results suggested that the Tat amino acid sequences were conserved among each group of samples and did not change significantly compared with the consensus sequence in previous studies. Several factors make Tat an attractive target for vaccine design

	16025547, ptimisation of a multipartite human immunodeficiency virus based vector system; control of virus infectivity and large-scale production.BACKGROUND: We have previously described a five-plasmid HIV-1 vector system that utilises a codon-optimised gagpol gene. While this system was shown to be safer than systems using proviral type helpers, the titre of virus produced was relatively low. Therefore, a process of optimising all aspects of virus production was initiated. METHODS: A systematic approach was taken to the optimisation of virus production by transient expression using a five-plasmid packaging system. Codon-manipulation was used to reduce homology between helper and vector constructs. Ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation were used for large-scale virus production. RESULTS: We describe codon-optimised reading frames for Tat and Rev and the optimisation of virus production. The optimisation process resulted in an increase in virus titre of 7- to 8-fold. Several other approaches to increasing viral titre described by others proved ineffective in our system after it had been optimised. In addition, we show that by varying the ratio of the GagPol helper construct to vector, the infectivity of the virus could be controlled. The use of a novel codon-optimised HIV-1 GagPol expression construct with reduced homology to vector sequences significantly reduced transfer of gagpol sequences to transduced cells. Virus could be collected in serum-free medium without a significant loss of titre, which facilitated subsequent processing. Processing using a combination of ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation allowed efficient and rapid processing of litre volumes of virus supernatant. CONCLUSIONS: By taking a systematic approach to optimising all aspects of our five-plasmid lentiviral vector system we improved titre, safety, large-scale production, and demonstrated that infectivity could be specifically controlled

	16051138, nd the noise played on: stochastic gene expression and HIV-1 infection.Stochastic gene expression has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes, including cell differentiation and disease. In this issue of Cell, take an integrated computational-experimental approach to study the Tat transactivation feedback loop of HIV-1. They show that fluctuations in a key regulator, Tat, in an isogenic population of infected cells result in two distinct expression states corresponding to latent and productive HIV-1 infection. These findings demonstrate the importance of stochastic gene expression in molecular  decision-making.

	16051143, tochastic gene expression in a lentiviral positive-feedback loop: HIV-1 Tat fluctuations drive phenotypic diversity.HIV-1 Tat transactivation is vital for completion of the viral life cycle and has been implicated in determining proviral latency. We present an extensive experimental/computational study of an HIV-1 model vector (LTR-GFP-IRES-Tat) and show that stochastic fluctuations in Tat influence the viral latency decision. Low GFP/Tat expression was found to generate bifurcating phenotypes with clonal populations derived from single proviral integrations simultaneously exhibiting very high and near zero GFP expression. Although phenotypic bifurcation (PheB) was correlated with distinct genomic integration patterns, neither these patterns nor other extrinsic cellular factors (cell cycle/size, aneuploidy, chromatin silencing, etc.) explained PheB. Stochastic computational modeling successfully accounted for PheB and correctly predicted the dynamics of a Tat mutant that were subsequently confirmed by experiment. Thus, Tat stochastics appear sufficient to generate PheB (and potentially proviral latency), illustrating the importance of stochastic fluctuations in gene expression in a mammalian system

	16115802, ong-term inhibition of HIV-1 infection in primary hematopoietic cells by lentiviral vector delivery of a triple combination of anti-HIV shRNA, anti-CCR5 ribozyme, and a nucleolar-localizing TAR decoy.Combinatorial therapies for the treatment of HIV-1 infection have proven to be effective in reducing patient viral loads and slowing the progression to AIDS. We have developed a series of RNA-based inhibitors for use in a gene therapy-based treatment for HIV-1 infection. The transcriptional units have been inserted into the backbone of a replication-defective lentiviral vector capable of transducing a wide array of cell types, including CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells. The combinatorial therapeutic RNA vector harbors a U6 Pol III promoter-driven short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting the rev and tat mRNAs of HIV-1, a U6 transcribed nucleolar-localizing TAR RNA decoy, and a VA1-derived Pol III cassette that expresses an anti-CCR5 ribozyme. Each of these therapeutic RNAs targets a different gene product and blocks HIV infection by a distinct mechanism. Our results demonstrate that the combinatorial vector suppresses HIV replication long term in a more-than-additive fashion relative to the single shRNA or double shRNA/ribozyme or decoy combinations. Our data demonstrate the validity and efficacy of a combinatorial RNA-based gene therapy for the treatment of HIV-1 infection

	16219384, inear double-stranded DNA that mimics an infective tail of virus genome to enhance transfection.Our previous work showed that a natural beta-(1--&gt;3)-d-glucan schizophyllan (SPG) can form a stable complex with single-stranded oligonucleotides (ssODNs). When protein transduction peptides were attached to SPG and this modified SPG was complexed with ssODNs, the resultant complex could induce cellular transfection of the bound ODNs, without producing serious cytotoxicity. However, no technique was available to transfect double-stranded DNAs (dsDNA) or plasmid DNA using SPG. This paper presents a new approach to transfect dsDNA, showing preparation and transfection efficiency for a minimal-size gene having a loop-shaped poly(dA)(80) on both ends. This poly(dA) loops of dsDNA can form a complex with SPG. An siRNA-coding dsDNA with the poly(dA) loop was complexed with Tat-attached SPG to silence luciferase expression. When LTR-Luc-HeLa cells that can express luciferase under the control of the LTR promoter were exposed to this complex, the expression of luciferase was suppressed (i.e., RNAi effect was enhanced). Cytotoxicity studies showed that the Tat-SPG complex induced much less cell death compared to polyethylenimine, indicating that the proposed method caused less harm than the conventional method. The Tat-SPG/poly(dA) looped dsDNA complex had a structure similar to the viral genome in that the dsDNA ends were able to induce transfection and protection. The present work identifies the SPG and poly(dA) looped minimum-sized gene combination as a candidate for a non-toxic gene delivery system

	16432028, esign and preclinical evaluation of a multigene human immunodeficiency virus type 1 subtype C DNA vaccine for clinical trial.In this study, the design and preclinical development of a multigene human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C DNA vaccine are described, developed as part of the South African AIDS Vaccine Initiative (SAAVI). Genetic variation remains a major obstacle in the development of an HIV-1 vaccine and recent strategies have focused on constructing vaccines based on the subtypes dominant in the developing world, where the epidemic is most severe. The vaccine, SAAVI DNA-C, contains an equimolar mixture of two plasmids, pTHr.grttnC and pTHr.gp150CT, which express a polyprotein derived from Gag, reverse transcriptase (RT), Tat and Nef, and a truncated Env, respectively. Genes included in the vaccine were obtained from individuals within 3 months of infection and selection was based on closeness to a South African subtype C consensus sequence. All genes were codon-optimized for increased expression in humans. The genes have been modified for safety, stability and immunogenicity. Tat was inactivated through shuffling of gene fragments, whilst maintaining all potential epitopes; the active site of RT was mutated; 124 aa were removed from the cytoplasmic tail of gp160; and Nef and Gag myristylation sites were inactivated. Following vaccination of BALB/c mice, high levels of cytotoxic T lymphocytes were induced against multiple epitopes and the vaccine stimulated strong CD8+ gamma interferon responses. In addition, high titres of antibodies to gp120 were induced in guinea pigs. This vaccine is the first component of a prime-boost regimen that is scheduled for clinical trials in humans in the USA and South Africa

	16438649, he Effect of a Single Nucleotide Substitution in the Splicing Silencer in the tat/rev Intron on HIV Type 1 Envelope Expression.A complex mRNA splicing pattern, which remains to be fully characterized, influences HIV-1 gene expression. In this study, poor envelope expression of a primary HIV-1 isolate was observed and linked to increased splicing of the two coding exons of tat/rev. The substitution of a nucleotide G, located 28 nucleotides upstream of the splice acceptor site SA7 in the recently identified intron splicing silencer sequence, was found to be responsible for the poor envelope expression. A single nucleotide substitution of G with A at this position results in a poor envelope expression phenotype. Moreover, substitution of the nucleotide G with any other nucleotide in an infectious HIV-1 proviral clone, HXB2RU3, results in poor envelope expression. The substitution of this nucleotide reduces the hnRNP A1 binding affinity but increases the splicing of env mRNA. The nucleotide G at this position is highly conserved among HIV-1 isolates and appears to play a critical role in HIV-1 splicing

	16643974, orrelation between SIV Tat evolution and AIDS progression in cerebrospinal fluid of morphine-dependent and control macaques infected with SIV and SHIV.Morphine abuse has been associated with higher virus replication and accelerated disease progression in a non-human primate model of AIDS. In our previous report, we have shown that 50% of morphine-addicted macaques progress rapidly and that 2/3 of the rapid progressors exhibit severe neuropathogenesis. In this report, we examined the sequence evolution of the SIV Tat protein, known to participate in AIDS neuropathology, in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of morphine-dependent and control macaques over the first 20 weeks of infection. The CSF SIV Tat evolution was found to be inversely related with disease progression, and the highly neuropathogenic inoculum clone sequence was the prevalent CSF form in rapid progressors. Divergence from the inoculum clone was significantly greater in both morphine-dependent normal progressors and control macaques than in the morphine-dependent rapid progressors. Furthermore, we also found evidence of a trend that morphine alters the type of mutation, resulting in an enhanced ratio of transitions to transversions (Ts:Tv). Rapid disease exacerbates this trend and appears to influence the distribution of nonsynonymous changes in the first exon of SIV tat, with a clear majority of mutations occurring in the C-terminal half of the protein where the known functionally important domains reside. Thus, morphine abuse may change the nature and extent of mutations that drive viral evolution

	16764723, nduction of the HIV-1 Tat co-factor cyclin T1 during monocyte differentiation is required for the regulated expression of a large portion of cellular mRNAs.BACKGROUND: P-TEFb, a general RNA polymerase II elongation factor, is composed of CDK9 (cyclin-dependent kinase 9) as a catalytic unit and either cyclin T1, T2 or K as a regulatory subunit. The cyclin T1/P-TEFb complex is targeted by HIV to mediate Tat transactivation. Cyclin T1 protein expression is induced during early macrophage differentiation, suggesting a role in regulation of mRNA expression during the differentiation process. To study the functional significance of cyclin T1 induction during differentiation, we utilized the human Mono Mac 6 (MM6) monocytic cell line. RESULTS: We found that cyclin T1 protein expression is induced by a post-transcriptional mechanism following PMA treatment of MM6 cells, similar to its induction in primary monocytes and macrophages. Also in agreement with findings in primary cells, cyclin T2a is present at relatively high levels in MM6 cells and is not induced by PMA. Although the knock-down of cyclin T1 in MM6 cells by shRNA inhibited HIV-1 Tat transactivation, MM6 cell growth was not affected by the depletion of cyclin T1. Using DNA microarray technology, we found that more than 20% of genes induced by PMA require cyclin T1 for their normal level of induction, and approximately 15% of genes repressed by PMA require cyclin T1 for their normal level of repression. Gene ontology analysis indicates that many of these cyclin T1-dependent genes are related to immune response and signal transduction. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that cyclin T1 serves a critical role in the program of macrophage differentiation, and this raises questions about the feasibility of cyclin T1 serving as an antiviral therapeutic target

	16934786, yaluronan induces vascular smooth muscle cell migration through RHAMM-mediated PI3K-dependent Rac activation.OBJECTIVE: Hyaluronan (HA) is an important constituent of the extracellular matrix and is known to regulate cellular events through binding to CD44 and the receptor for HA-mediated motility (RHAMM). Here we investigated the role of these receptors and the signaling pathways involved in HA-mediated effects in arterial smooth muscle cells (ASMC). METHODS: Effects of high-molecular weight HA (1 to 5 mg/ml) were analyzed in cultured ASMC from rat aorta. RESULTS: HA promoted actin stress fiber and lamellipodia formation and dose-dependently induced ASMC migration without effect on proliferation. Pull-down assay of Rho protein activity indicated that HA activated RhoA and Rac. HA-induced ASMC migration was not affected by the RhoA inhibitor Tat-C3 (10 microg/ml), the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (10 microM) and blocking anti-CD44 antibody ,but was reduced by the non-selective Rho protein inhibitor simvastatin (10 microM), the Rac inhibitor LT-toxin (1 mug/ml), small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting Rac and the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 (25 microM), which also blocked HA-induced Rac activation. CD44 knockdown by siRNA inhibited HA-mediated RhoA activation without effect on ASMC migration. In contrast, siRNA targeting RHAMM inhibited both HA-induced migration and Rac activation. CONCLUSIONS: High-molecular weight HA independently activates RhoA and Rac through CD44 and RHAMM, respectively. HA-induced migration depends exclusively on RHAMM-mediated PI3K-dependent Rac activation

	17148965, otent knock down of HIV-1 replication by targeting HIV-1 Tat/Rev RNA sequences synergistically with catalytic RNA and DNA.OBJECTIVE: Ribozymes (Rzs) and DNA-enzymes (Dzs) possess the ability to prevent gene expression by cleaving target RNA in a catalytic and sequence-specific manner. Although Rzs or Dzs have been used earlier for HIV-1 gene suppression, the present study explored the possibility of using catalytic RNA and DNA simultaneously in a synergistic manner with the hope that this novel approach will allow more potent inhibition for a longer duration. METHODS: In order to achieve long-term inhibition of HIV-1 replication, a novel non-GUX hammerhead Rz was designed by standard recombinant DNA technology and cloned it under the powerful CMV promoter containing expression vector. A 10-23 catalytic motif containing Dz that was targeted against the conserved second exon of HIV-1 Tat/Rev region was also assembled. RESULTS: Both Rz and Dz possessed sequence-specific cleavage activities individually and simultaneously cleaved target RNA in a synergistic manner under the same in vitro cleavage conditions. These catalytic molecules inhibited HIV-1 replication in macrophages individually and exhibited potent inhibitory effects when used in combination. CONCLUSIONS: The combination strategy described here can be widely used against any target RNA to achieve more effective gene inhibition that exploits the simultaneous sequence-specific cleavage potentials of catalytic RNA and DNA

	17209773, hylogenetic analysis of env, gag, and tat genes of HIV type 1 detected among the injecting drug users in West Bengal, India.A recent occurrence of HIV-1 seropositivity among a group of injecting drug users (IDUs) in Darjeeling, a hilly district in northern West Bengal, revealed overall 11.8% HIV seroprevalence. Our study based on env (C2-V3), gag (p24-p7), and tat (exon-1) genomic regions of HIV-1 detected among this population showed that Darjeeling IDU sequences belonged to subtype C. Interestingly, the IDU sequences from Darjeeling were again found to be closer to the C strains from Manipur, a northeastern state in India, which is linked to the Golden Triangle via the Manipur-Myanmar border, rather than the IDU C sequences from Nepal, a neighboring country of India. The outgroup reference strains from different sites of IDU-driven epidemics in the world like Russia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Spain belonged to the nonsubtype C group and formed separate clusters from the subtype C cluster in our analysis. These results indicate a rapid spread of HIV-1 by possible drug trafficking along international boundaries, which might also help in the invasion of HIV-1 among IDUs of Darjeeling through the Manipur-Myanmar border of India

	17402200, Study on the relationship between the polymorphisms and secondary structure of tat exon-1 gene and HIV/ AIDS progress in subtype B' and B'/C]OBJECTIVE: To study the polymorphisms and secondary structure of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) tat exon 1 among subtype B' and B'/C HIV-1 infected people in China and to explore the relationship between the polymorphism of tat exon 1 and the disease progression. METHODS: 8 subtype B' and 5 B'/C HIV-1 infected patients with slow disease progression were selected from Liaoning, Jilin and Yunnan province. 26 subtype B' and 9 B'/C HIV-1 infected patients with similar sex, age but with typical disease progression were selected. Provirus was extracted from the whole blood. The gene sequences of the Tat exon 1 were amplified by nest-polymerase chain reaction (nest-PCR). Products were purified and sequenced directly. The sequences were aligned, translated, amino acid substitution were analyzed and secondary structures were predicted. RESULTS: Many amino acid substitution could be found in the exon 1 of Tat in HIV-1 subtype B' and B'/C recombinant strain infected persons with different disease progression except A58T,none of them showed definitely relationship with HIV viral load and disease progression. 23N, 31S, 32Y and 46F were subtype-specific substitutions. No characteristic secondary structure of exon 1 of Tat was found. CONCLUSION: Some of the mutations of tat exon 1 might be related to HIV viral load and disease progression. However, there was no relationship found between the secondary structure of Tat protein and the disease progression

	17406343, afety and efficacy of a lentiviral vector containing three anti-HIV genes--CCR5 ribozyme, tat-rev siRNA, and TAR decoy--in SCID-hu mouse-derived T cells.Gene therapeutic strategies show promise in controlling human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and in restoring immunological function. A number of efficacious anti-HIV gene constructs have been described so far, including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), RNA decoys, transdominant proteins, and ribozymes, each with a different mode of action. However, as HIV is prone to generating escape mutants, the use of a single anti-HIV construct would not be adequate to afford long range-viral protection. On this basis, a combination of highly potent anti-HIV genes--namely, a short hairpin siRNA (shRNA) targeting rev and tat, a transactivation response (TAR) decoy, and a CCR5 ribozyme--have been inserted into a third-generation lentiviral vector. Our recent in vitro studies with this construct, Triple-R, established its efficacy in both T-cell lines and CD34 cell-derived macrophages. In this study, we have evaluated this combinatorial vector in vivo. Vector-transduced CD34 cells were injected into severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-hu mouse thy/liv grafts to determine their capacity to give rise to T cells. Our results show that phenotypically normal transgenic T cells are generated that are able to resist HIV-1 infection when challenged in vitro. These important attributes of this combinatorial vector show its promise as an excellent candidate for use in human clinical trials

	17451348, igh frequency of defective vpu compared with tat and rev genes in brain from patients with HIV type 1-associated dementia.Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection of the central nervous system frequently causes HIV-associated dementia (HAD) and other neurological disorders. The role of HIV regulatory and accessory proteins in the pathogenesis of these disorders is unclear. Here we analyzed sequences of tat, rev, and vpu genes in 55 subgenomic clones previously shown to encode functional env genes from brain and lymphoid tissues of four AIDS patients with HAD. Phylogenetic analysis showed distinct compartmentalization of tat, rev, and vpu genes in brain versus lymphoid tissues. Nine of 19 vpu sequences from brain of two patients had premature stop codons at positions between amino acids 2 and 30, compared with 0 of 8 from lymphoid tissues. Tat sequences from brain (n = 8 of 8) but not lymphoid (n = 0 of 6) tissue from one patient had a 35 amino acid truncation at the C-terminus. Rev sequences from the brain of one patient (n = 6 of 8) had a 5 amino acid truncation. These results demonstrate a high frequency of defective vpu compared with tat and rev genes in brain from HAD patients, and identify sequence variants of these regulatory/accessory genes that may influence the pathogenesis of HIV-associated neurological disease

	17474072, nhibition of HIV-1 multiplication by a modified U7 snRNA inducing Tat and Rev exon skipping.The HIV-1 regulatory proteins Tat and Rev are encoded by multiply spliced mRNAs that differ by the use of alternative 3' splice sites at the beginning of the internal exon. If these internal exons are skipped, the expression of these genes, and hence HIV-1 multiplication, should be inhibited. We have previously developed a strategy, based on antisense derivatives of U7 small nuclear RNA, that allows us to induce the skipping of an internal exon in virtually any gene. Here, we have successfully applied this approach to induce a partial skipping of the Tat, Rev (and Nef) internal exons. Three functional U7 constructs were subcloned into a lentiviral vector. Two of them strongly reduced the efficiency of lentiviral particle production compared to vectors carrying either no U7 insert or unrelated U7 cassettes. This defect could be partly or fully compensated by coexpressing Rev from an unspliced mRNA in the producing cell line. Upon stable transduction into CEM-SS or CEM T-lymphocytes, the most efficient of these constructs inhibits HIV-1 multiplication. Although the inhibition is not complete, it is more efficient in combination with another mechanism inhibiting HIV multiplication. Therefore, this new approach targeting HIV-1 regulatory genes at the level of pre-mRNA splicing, in combination with other antiviral strategies, may be a useful new tool in the fight against HIV/AIDS

	17485285, vercoming HIV-1 resistance to RNA interference.RNAi refers to the sequence-specific degradation of RNA that follows the cellular introduction of homologous short interfering (si) RNA. RNAi has emerged as a powerful tool to probe the function of genes of known sequence in vitro and in vivo. Advances in vector design permit the effective expression of siRNA in human cells. Numerous recent investigations have described the ability of RNAi to decrease the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in lymphocytic cells using siRNA targeting viral (e.g. tat, gag, rev) and host (e.g. CCR5, CD4) proteins. Can RNAi be used as a form of genetic therapy for HIV-1 infection? Recent data indicate that the dynamic replication kinetics of HIV-1 pose a considerable barrier to achieving durable virus suppression by RNAi with the rapid emergence of HIV-1 mutants resistant to siRNA. This review summarizes recent work on HIV-1 specific RNAi with a focus on potential strategies to overcome HIV-1 resistance to RNAi

	17499380, ong terminal repeat sequences from virulent and attenuated equine infectious anemia virus demonstrate distinct promoter activities.In the early 1970s, the Chinese Equine Infectious Anemia Virus (EIAV) vaccine, EIAV(DLA), was developed through successive passages of a wild-type virulent virus (EIAV(L)) in donkeys in vivo and then in donkey macrophages in vitro. EIAV attenuation and cell tropism adaptation are associated with changes in both envelope and long terminal repeat (LTR). However, specific LTR changes during Chinese EIAV attenuation have not been demonstrated. In this study, we compared LTR sequences from both virulent and attenuated EIAV strains and documented the diversities of LTR sequence from in vivo and in vitro infections. We found that EIAV LTRs of virulent strains were homologous, while EIAV vaccine have variable LTRs. Interestingly, experimental inoculation of EIAV(DLA) into a horse resulted in a restriction of the LTR variation. Furthermore, LTRs from EIAV(DLA) showed higher Tat transactivated activity than LTRs from virulent strains. By using chimeric clones of wild-type LTR and vaccine LTR, the main difference of activity was mapped to the changes of R region, rather than U3 region

	17925344, n vitro dimerization of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) spliced RNAs.The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) packages its genomic RNA as a dimer of homologous RNA molecules that has to be selected among a multitude of cellular and viral RNAs. Interestingly, spliced viral mRNAs are packaged into viral particles with a relatively low efficiency despite the fact that they contain most of the extended packaging signal found in the 5' untranslated region of the genomic RNA, including the dimerization initiation site (DIS). As a consequence, HIV-1 spliced viral RNAs can theoretically homodimerize and heterodimerize with the genomic RNA, and thus they should directly compete with genomic RNA for packaging. To shed light on this issue, we investigated for the first time the in vitro dimerization properties of spliced HIV-1 RNAs. We found that singly spliced (env, vpr) and multispliced (tat, rev, and nef) RNA fragments are able to dimerize in vitro, and to efficiently form heterodimers with genomic RNA. Chemical probing experiments and inhibition of RNA dimerization by an antisense oligonucleotide directed against the DIS indicated that the DIS is structurally functional in spliced HIV-1 RNA, and that RNA dimerization occurs through a loop-loop interaction. In addition, by combining in vitro transcription and dimerization assays, we show that heterodimers can be efficiently formed only when the two RNA fragments are synthesized simultaneously, in the same environment. Together, our results support a model in which RNA dimerization would occur during transcription in the nucleus and could thus play a major role in splicing, transport, and localization of HIV-1 RNA

	17961115, ene expression analysis from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 subtype C promoter and construction of bicistronic reporter vectors.We report the cloning and sequence analysis of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of several primary HIV-1 subtype C strains of India. Phylogenetically, all the LTRs and the paired env sequences clustered with subtype C reference strains. The LTRs demonstrated extensive polymorphism in the transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) within the enhancer and the modulator regions. We generated reporter vectors under the control of a select subset of the subtype C LTRs. The reporter vectors are distinguished by the simultaneous expression of two independent reporter genes, secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) and enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP), in response to Tat. Expression of EGFP was facilitated by engineering an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) into the expression cassette. Although subtype C strains cause a large majority of the global infections, and important differences in the transcription factor binding sites have been identified in the subtype C promoter, few reporter vectors containing subtype C-LTR have been described. We analyzed gene expression from the C-LTR reporter vectors in different cell lines under diverse experimental conditions and compared it to the B-LTR reporter vector. The reporter vectors were responsive to Tat derived from diverse viral subtypes. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between the expression of the reporter genes and the viral structural protein p24 when the cells were infected with viral molecular clones. The LTR reporters we developed could be of significant use in the study of viral transactivation, in the evaluation of biological properties of viral subtypes, and in the screening for antiviral inhibitors

	18051367, xpression profiles and pathway analysis in HEK 293 T cells overexpressing HIV-1 Tat and nucleocapsid using cDNA microarray.Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infections are responsible for a substantial number of deaths annually and represent a significant threat to public health. According to the latest study, the Tat (Transactivator of transcription) protein is essential in transcription and replication of viral genes, and is among the early expression genes involved in the life cycle of HIV. The virion NC (nucleocapsid) plays an important role in early mRNA expression and contributes to the rapid viral replication that occurs during HIV-1 infection. Therefore, we attempted to elucidate the relationship between the Tat protein and nucleocapsid protein. In a comparison of two independently prepared and hybridized samples, flag NC overexpressed HEK 293T cells and pTat overexpressed HEK 293T cells, and hybridization showed the differences in expression in each case. Among the microarray results confirmed with real-time reverse transcriptase assay, twelve genes were identified to be involved according to their gene expression profiles. Of approximately 8,208 human genes that were analyzed, we monitored candidate genes that might have been related to NC and Tat genes from gene expression profiles. Additionally, the pathways could be viewed and analyzed through the use of PathwayStudio software. The pathways from the gene list were built and paths were found among the molecules/cell objects/processes by the curation method

	18070983, F-kappaB-dependent control of HIV-1 transcription by the second coding exon of Tat in T cells.HIV-1 two-exon transactivator protein (Tat) is a 101-aa protein. We investigated the possible contribution of the extreme C terminus of HIV-1 Tat to maximize nuclear transcription factor NF-kappaB activation, long terminal repeat (LTR) transactivation, and viral replication in T cells. C-terminal deletion and substitution mutants made with the infectious clone HIV-89.6 were assayed for their ability to transactivate NF-kappaB-secreted alkaline phosphatase and HIV-1 LTR-luciferase reporter constructs for low concentrations of Tat. A mutant infectious clone of HIV-89.6 engineered by introducing a stop codon at aa 72 in the Tat open-reading frame (HIVDeltatatexon2) replicated at a significantly lower rate than the wild-type HIV-89.6 in phytohemagglutinin-A/IL-2-stimulated primary peripheral blood lymphocytes. Altogether, our results suggest a critical role for the glutamic acids at positions 92, 94, and 96 or lysines at positions 88, 89, and 90, present in the second encoding Tat exon in activating NF-kappaB, transactivating the HIV-1 LTR and enhancing HIV-1 replication in T cells

	18241354, IV-1 infection induces changes in expression of cellular splicing factors that regulate alternative viral splicing and virus production in macrophages.BACKGROUND: Macrophages are important targets and long-lived reservoirs of HIV-1, which are not cleared of infection by currently available treatments. In the primary monocyte-derived macrophage model of infection, replication is initially productive followed by a decline in virion output over ensuing weeks, coincident with a decrease in the levels of the essential viral transactivator protein Tat. We investigated two possible mechanisms in macrophages for regulation of viral replication, which appears to be primarily regulated at the level of tat mRNA: 1) differential mRNA stability, used by cells and some viruses for the rapid regulation of gene expression and 2) control of HIV-1 alternative splicing, which is essential for optimal viral replication. RESULTS: Following termination of transcription at increasing times after infection in macrophages, we found that tat mRNA did indeed decay more rapidly than rev or nef mRNA, but with similar kinetics throughout infection. In addition, tat mRNA decayed at least as rapidly in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Expression of cellular splicing factors in uninfected and infected macrophage cultures from the same donor showed an inverse pattern over time between enhancing factors (members of the SR family of RNA binding proteins) and inhibitory factors (members of the hnRNP family). While levels of the SR protein SC35 were greatly up-regulated in the first week or two after infection, hnRNPs of the A/B and H groups were down-regulated. Around the peak of virus production in each culture, SC35 expression declined to levels in uninfected cells or lower, while the hnRNPs increased to control levels or above. We also found evidence for increased cytoplasmic expression of SC35 following long-term infection. CONCLUSION: While no evidence of differential regulation of tat mRNA decay was found in macrophages following HIV-1 infection, changes in the balance of cellular splicing factors which regulate alternative viral pre-mRNA splicing were observed. These changes correlated with changes in Tat expression and virus production and could play an important role in viral persistence in macrophages. This mechanism could provide a novel target for control of infection in this critical cell type, which would be necessary for eventual eradication of the virus from infected individuals

	18300036, e>Tat-mediated intracellular delivery of T-bet protein into THP-1 cells can induce Th1-type response.T-bet, a Th1-specific transcription factor, can promote the production of IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma is the principal Th1 effector cytokine and it has a crucial role in Th1 differentiation, which can drive the differentiation of naïve CD4+T cells into T-helper 1 (Th1) cells. In our study, a human T-bet gene was fused with a gene fragment encoding HIV-1 protein transduction domain in a bacterial expression vector to produce a Tat/T-bet fusion protein. The expressed and purified Tat/T-bet proteins were transduced efficiently into THP-1 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner; when Tat/T-bet pretreated THP-1 cells were co-cultured with CD4+T cells, the IFN-gamma level increased higher to about 7 pg/ml, 10-folds as compared with the normal level when tested at 48 hours. The results demonstrated that the Tat/T-bet fusion protein can be efficiently transduced into antigen-presenting cells (APCs) like THP-1 cells and then regulated Th1/Th2 balance, which may act as a potential tool for gene therapy

	18365714, nteraction of HIV RNA with peptides detected by acoustic shear wave sensor operated in an on-line format.Acoustic wave sensors are now widely used in various clinical applications because they allow real-time data to be rapidly obtained. In this chapter we describe the use of the thickness shear mode (TSM) acoustic wave sensor to study the interaction between the transactivation responsive region (TAR) of the HIV-1 mRNA and short peptides derived from the regulatory Tat protein as well as with two inhibitor molecules, namely neomycin and streptomycin. The interaction between the TAR-Tat system is a target for the development of antiviral drugs

	18366309, e>Tat-specific binding IgG and disease progression in HIV type 1-infected Ugandans.There are data to suggest that both the humoral and cellular immune responses directed against Tat are beneficial in delaying HIV disease progression. We examined the association between the occurrence of Tat-specific binding antibodies (Abs) and different parameters of HIV-1 disease progression. We generated eight Tat proteins, derived from HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C, and D, and circulating recombinant form CRF01_AE. These proteins were used to screen for Tat-specific binding Abs by an ELISA. Using five Tat proteins, we investigated whether the occurrence of Tat-specific Abs within 2 years after seroconversion for the majority, affected disease progression over time among 126 participants using survival analysis and rate of CD4 decline. Of these, 52 participants with a sample at 1.5 and 4.5 years after seroconversion were further examined to study the effect of Tat-specific Ab loss or maintenance on disease progression. Finally, using all the eight Tat proteins, we also investigated whether specific Abs to these Tat proteins among 48 participants, grouped as rapid progressors (RP, n = 26) and long-term survivors (LTS, n = 22) according to their CD4 decline over time, affected disease progression. Survival analysis did not reveal any evidence of protection from progression by Tat-specific Abs. Comparison of rate of CD4 declines between individuals with and without Abs to any Tat protein showed only a small and borderline significant advantage of having Tat-specific Abs (p = 0.043). There was no correlation between either loss or maintenance of Tat-specific Abs and disease progression. Comparison of LTS with RP showed no evidence that Tat-specific Abs slows participants' disease progression. This study showed no evidence of a protective effect of having Tat-specific Abs among these Ugandan subjects

	18367519, ontribution of CD8+ T cells to containment of viral replication and emergence of mutations in Mamu-A*01-restricted epitopes in Simian immunodeficiency virus-infected rhesus monkeys.Here, we investigated the containment of virus replication in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection by CD8(+) lymphocytes. Escape mutations in Mamu-A*01 epitopes appeared first in SIV Tat TL8 and then in SIV Gag p11C. The appearance of escape mutations in SIV Gag p11C was coincident with compensatory changes outside of the epitope. Eliminating CD8(+) lymphocytes from rhesus monkeys during primary infection resulted in more rapid disease progression that was associated with preservation of canonical epitopes. These results confirm the importance of cytotoxic T cells in controlling viremia and the constraint on epitope sequences that require compensatory changes to go to fixation

	18373319, racking of primary human hepatocytes with clinical MRI: initial results with Tat-peptide modified superparamagnetic iron oxide particles.The transplantation of primary human hepatocytes is a promising approach in the treatment of specific liver diseases. However, little is known about the fate of the cells following application. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could enable real-time tracking and long-term detection of transplanted hepatocytes. The use of superparamagnetic iron oxide particles as cellular contrast agents should allow for the non-invasive detection of labelled cells on high-resolution magnetic resonance images. Experiments were performed on primary human hepatocytes to transfer the method of detecting labelled cells via clinical MRI into human hepatocyte transplantation. For labelling, Tat-peptide modified nano-sized superparamagnetic MagForce particles were used. Cells were investigated via a clinical MR scanner at 3.0 Tesla and the particle uptake within single hepatocytes was estimated using microscopic examinations. The labelled primary human hepatocytes were clearly detectable by MRI, proving the feasibility of this new concept. Therefore, this method is a useful tool to investigate the effects of human hepatocyte transplantation and to improve safety aspects of this method

	18397318, tudy of uptake of cell penetrating peptides and their cargoes in permeabilized wheat immature embryos.The uptake of five fluorescein labeled cell-penetrating peptides (Tat, Tat(2), mutated-Tat, peptide vascular endothelial-cadherin and transportan) was studied in wheat immature embryos. Interestingly, permeabilization treatment of the embryos with toluene/ethanol (1 : 20, v/v with permeabilization buffer) resulted in a remarkably higher uptake of cell-penetrating peptides, whereas nonpermeabilized embryos failed to show significant cell-penetrating peptide uptake, as observed under fluorescence microscope and by fluorimetric analysis. Among the cell-penetrating peptides investigated, Tat monomer (Tat) showed highest fluorescence uptake (4.2-fold greater) in permeabilized embryos than the nonpermeabilized embryos. On the other hand, mutated-Tat serving as negative control did not show comparable fluorescence levels even in permeabilized embryos. A glucuronidase histochemical assay revealed that Tat peptides can efficiently deliver functionally active beta-glucuronidase (GUS) enzyme in permeabilized immature embryos. Tat(2)-mediated GUS enzyme delivery showed the highest number of embryos with GUS uptake (92.2%) upon permeabilization treatment with toluene/ethanol (1 : 40, v/v with permeabilization buffer) whereas only 51.8% of nonpermeabilized embryos showed Tat(2)-mediated GUS uptake. Low temperature, endocytosis and macropinocytosis inhibitors reduced delivery of the Tat(2)-GUS enzyme cargo complex. The results suggest that more than one mechanism of cell entry is involved simultaneously in cell-penetrating peptide-cargo uptake in wheat immature embryos. We also studied Tat(2)-plasmid DNA (carrying Act-1GUS) complex formation by gel retardation assay, DNaseI protection assay and confocal laser microscopy. Permeabilized embryos transfected with Tat(2)-plasmid DNA complex showed 3.3-fold higher transient GUS gene expression than the nonpermeabilized embryos. Furthermore, addition of cationic transfecting agent Lipofectamine 2000 to the Tat(2)-plasmid DNA complex resulted in 1.5-fold higher transient GUS gene expression in the embryos. This is the first report demonstrating translocation of various cell-penetrating peptides and their potential to deliver macromolecules in wheat immature embryos in the presence of a cell membrane permeabilizing agent

	18418067, 14ARF is capable of promoting HIV-1 tat degradation.The p14(ARF) tumor suppressor functions as 'oncogenic checkpoint' that prevents unrestricted cellular proliferation in response to oncogenic signaling. Albeit, the major pathway through which ARF operates is the ARF-Mdm2-p53 axis, ARF directly binds to and inactivates transcription function of a number of DNA-bound activators. In the present study we show that p14(ARF) inhibits transcription activation of HIV-1 LTR promoter activity by Tat protein. Tat protein is a RNA-bound transcriptional activator whose function is strictly required for HIV-1 replication. We determined that p14(ARF) inhibits Tat transactivation of HIV-1 LTR by promoting Tat degradation via an ubiquitin-independent pathway

	18431124, ffect of disrupting N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-postsynaptic density protein-95 interactions on the threshold for halothane anesthesia in mice.BACKGROUND: The authors' previous studies have shown that clinically relevant concentrations of inhalational anesthetics dose-dependently and specifically inhibit the PSD-95, Dlg, and ZO-1 (PDZ) domain-mediated protein interactions between postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, and that the knockdown of spinal PSD-95 by intrathecal injection of PSD-95 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide significantly reduces the minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration for isoflurane in rats. METHODS: The authors constructed a fusion peptide, Tat-PSD-95 PDZ2, comprising the second PDZ domain of PSD-95, which can specifically disrupt PSD-95 PDZ2-mediated protein interactions by binding to its interaction partner. By intraperitoneal injection of this fusion peptide into mice, the authors investigated the effect of disrupting the PSD-95 PDZ2-mediated protein interactions on the threshold for halothane anesthesia. RESULTS: Systemically injected fusion peptide Tat-PSD-95 PDZ2 was delivered into the central nervous system, disrupted the protein-protein interactions between N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor NR2 subunits and PSD-95, and significantly reduced the minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration and righting reflex EC50 for halothane. CONCLUSIONS: By disrupting PSD-95 PDZ2 domain-mediated protein interactions, intraperitoneal injection of cell-permeant fusion peptide Tat-PSD-95 PDZ2 dose-dependently reduces the threshold for halothane anesthesia. These results suggest that PDZ domain-mediated protein interactions at synapses in the central nervous system might play an important role in the molecular mechanisms of halothane anesthesia

	18455803, uantitative evaluation of chaperone activity and neuroprotection by different preparations of a cell-penetrating Hsp70.Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), such as the one derived from the human immunodeficiency virus Tat protein, facilitate the delivery of cargoes across cellular membranes. However, questions about the therapeutic potential of CPP-mediated delivery remain. For instance, the impact of the purification procedure on the functionality of Tat-fusion proteins has not been systematically examined. Here, we isolated fusion proteins of the chaperone heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and the Tat CPP under denaturing or native conditions. To investigate the therapeutic potential of different recombinant protein preparations, we examined Tat-Hsp70 transduction efficiency and quantified Tat-Hsp70-mediated folding of a chaperone-dependent yellow fluorescent protein in vitro. Transduction efficiency and chaperone activity of Tat-Hsp70-treated cells was significantly higher compared to cells treated with Hsp70. The application of native isolated Tat-Hsp70 had the strongest effect. This chaperone activity correlates with increased viability of cells treated with the recombinant protein after cell death induction with 6-hydroxydopamine. This suggests that the method of recombinant Tat-fusion protein purification influences its functionality. For Tat-Hsp70, the method of choice seems to be isolation under native conditions, for which we present a purification protocol. Our results may contribute to improve Tat-fusion protein application in basic research and may facilitate its use as therapeutic tool, for instance in Parkinson's disease

	18466992, nalysis of Jembrana disease virus mRNA transcripts produced during acute infection demonstrates a complex transcription pattern.Jembrana disease virus (JDV) is an unusual bovine lentivirus that causes an acute disease syndrome with a 20% case fatality rate after a short incubation period in Bos javanicus (Bali cattle) in Indonesia. Analysis of tat mRNA transcription patterns has identified up to six differently spliced transcripts indicating that, in common with other lentiviruses, JDV uses a complex splicing pattern. RT-PCR analysis of mRNA transcripts produced during the acute phase of infection with JDV(TAB/87) revealed at least 12 differently spliced transcripts involving 9 different splice sites. A single unspliced gag/pol transcript, singly spliced vif and tmx specific transcripts and alternatively spliced env, tat and rev transcripts were identified. A 67 nucleotide putative non-coding exon was identified that shared the same splice acceptor (SA) as vif and was incorporated into alternative transcripts of tat, rev and env

	18524464, ransfection efficiency of TDL compound in HUVEC enhanced by ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction.The aim of the present study was to explore the gene transfection efficiency of Tat peptide/plasmid DNA/ liposome (TDL) compound combined with ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC). Tat peptide, plasmid DNA (pIRES2-EGFP-HGF) and Lipofectamine 2000 were used to prepare the TDL compound. Microbubbles were prepared using mechanic vibration. The expression of the report gene enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was observed using fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry. The viability of HUVEC was measured by MTT assay. mRNA and protein of HGF was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western Blot. The intensity of green fluorescence and the gene transfection efficiency of TDL compound + microbubbles + ultrasound group were higher than those of other groups, and no significantly different viability was found between TDL compound + microbubbles + ultrasound group and the other groups. The HGF mRNA and HGF protein of TDL compound + microbubbles + ultrasound group were higher than those of other groups. Our finding demonstrated that UTMD could enhance the transfection efficiency of TDL compound without obvious effects on the cell viability of HUVEC, suggesting that the combination of UTMD and TDL compound might be a useful tool for the gene therapy of ischemic heart disease

	18551626, orphine causes rapid increases in glial activation and neuronal injury in the striatum of inducible HIV-1 Tat transgenic mice.HIV encephalitis (HIVE) is accompanied by brain inflammation, leukocyte infiltration, and glial activation, and HIV patients who abuse opiates are more likely to develop HIVE. To better understand how opiates could alter HIV-related brain inflammation, the expression of astrocyte (GFAP immunoreactivity) and macrophage/microglial (F4/80 or Mac1 immunoreactivity) markers in the striatum, and the percentage of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) positive macrophages/microglia, was determined following a 2-day exposure to morphine (5 mg/kg/day via time-release, subcutaneous implant) and doxycycline in GFAP-driven, doxycycline-inducible HIV-1 Tat transgenic mice. Data show that both morphine and Tat induction via doxycycline increased astrocyte activation, with significant additive increases achieved with combined morphine and doxycycline exposure. By contrast, combined Tat induction and morphine exposure, but neither manipulation alone, significantly increased the proportion of macrophages/microglia present in the striatum of transgenic mice, although morphine exposure was necessary to elevate 3-NT co-detection in Mac1-positive macrophages/microglia. Finally, Tat induction increased the percentage of neurons expressing active caspase-3, and this was even more significantly elevated by co-administration of morphine. In spite of elevations in caspase-3, neuronal TUNEL reactivity was unchanged in all groups, even after 10 days of Tat induction. Importantly, co-administration of naltrexone completely antagonized the effects of morphine. These findings indicate that morphine rapidly and significantly increases the activation of astrocytes and macrophages/microglia in the brains of inducible Tat transgenic mice, supporting the theory that early inflammatory changes in glia could underlie the development of HIVE in opiate-abusing AIDS patients

	18571668, rganelle-targeted delivery of biological macromolecules using the protein transduction domain: potential applications for Peptide aptamer delivery into the nucleus.Extensive effort is currently being expended on the innovative design and engineering of new molecular carrier systems for the organelle-targeted delivery of biological cargoes (e.g., peptide aptamers or biological proteins) as tools in cell biology and for developing novel therapeutic approaches. Although cell-permeable Tat peptides are useful carriers for delivering biological molecules into the cell, much internalized Tat-fused cargo is trapped within macropinosomes and thus not delivered into organelles. Here, we devised a novel intracellular targeting technique to deliver Tat-fused cargo into the nucleus using an endosome-disruptive peptide (hemagglutinin-2 subunit) and a nuclear localization signal peptide. We show for the first time that Tat-conjugated peptide aptamers can be selectively delivered to the nucleus by using combined hemagglutinin-2 subunit and nuclear localization signal peptides. This nuclear targeting technique resulted in marked enhancement of the cytostatic activity of a Tat-fused p53-derived peptide aptamer against human MDM2 (mouse double minute 2) that inhibits p53-MDM2 binding. Thus, our technique provides a unique methodology for the development of novel therapeutic approaches based on intracellular targeting

	18573624, ffects of menstrual cycle on gene transfection through mouse vagina for DNA vaccine.Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections mainly occur through the vaginal and rectal mucosal membranes. In the present study, to develop a DNA vaginal vaccine against viral and bacterial infections, the effects of the menstrual cycle on DNA transfection through the vaginal mucosa in female mice and transfection enhancement by electroporation, a chelating agent, cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) and nuclear localizing signals (NLS) were investigated. The transfection efficiencies of a marker plasmid DNA (pDNA), pCMV-Luc, on the vaginal mucosal membrane in mice at the stages of metestrus and diestrus were significantly higher than those at the stages of proestrus and estrus. The gene expression was markedly enhanced by electroporation and by pretreatment with the chelating agent. The highest level of expression was obtained by 2h pretreatment with 5% citric acid solution combined with electroporation with 15 pulses at 250 V/cm for 5 milliseconds (ms). Furthermore, a synergistic promoting effect on pDNA transfection was obtained by co-administration of CPP, the Tat peptide analog, and NLS, the NF-kappaB analog. These results indicate that effective DNA vaccination administered through the vaginal tract is possible by selecting the menstrual stage and overcoming the mucosal barrier using a combination of methods that promotes uptake

	18596090, unctional analysis of the complex trans-activating response element RNA structure in simian immunodeficiency virus.Transcription of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is activated through binding of the viral Tat protein to the trans-activating response (TAR) element at the 5' end of the nascent transcript. Whereas HIV type 1 (HIV-1) TAR folds a simple hairpin structure, the corresponding domains of HIV-2 and SIVmac exhibit a more complex structure composed of three stem-loops. This structural polymorphism may be attributed to additional functions of TAR in HIV-2/SIVmac replication. We recently constructed an SIVmac variant that does not require the Tat-TAR interaction for transcription. We used this variant to study additional roles of TAR in SIVmac replication and generated mutants with a truncated TAR structure. We demonstrate that partial or nearly complete removal of TAR does not impair viral transcription, RNA processing, and translation. Moreover, these deletions do not significantly affect virus replication in the PM1 T-cell line and macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These results demonstrate that the complex TAR structure in SIVmac has no other essential function in virus replication in vitro besides its role in Tat-mediated activation of transcription

	18625037, dentification of new HIV-1 Gag-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in BALB/c mice.BACKGROUND: As HIV-specific cytotoxic T cells play a key role during acute and chronic HIV-1 infection in humans, the ability of potential anti-HIV vaccines to elicit strong, broad T cell responses is likely to be crucial. The HIV-1 Gag antigen is widely considered a relevant antigen for the development of an anti-HIV vaccine since it is one of the most conserved viral proteins and is also known to induce T cell responses. In the majority of studies reporting Gag-specific cellular immune responses induced by Gag-based vaccines, only a small number of Gag T cell epitopes were tested in preclinical mouse models, thus giving an incomplete picture of the numerous possible cellular immune responses against this antigen. As is, this partial knowledge of epitope-specific T cell responses directed to Gag will unavoidably result in a limited preclinical evaluation of Gag-based vaccines. RESULTS: In this study we identified new Gag CD8+ T cell epitopes in BALB/c mice vaccinated with the HIV-1 Gag antigen alone or in combination with the HIV-1 Tat protein, which was recently shown to broaden T cell responses directed to Gag. Specifically, we found that CTL responses to Gag may be directed to nine different CTL epitopes, and four of these were mapped as minimal CTL epitopes. CONCLUSION: These newly identified CTL epitopes should be considered in the preclinical evaluation of T cell responses induced by Gag-based vaccines in mice

	18644411, nternalisation of polymeric nanosensors in mesenchymal stem cells: analysis by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.The aim of this study was to demonstrate that flow cytometry and confocal microscopy could be applied in a complementary manner to analyse the internalisation of polymeric nanosensors in mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). The two techniques are able to provide en masse data analysis of nanosensors from large cell populations and detailed images of intracellular nanosensor localisation, respectively. The polyacrylamide nanosensors used in this investigation had been modified to contain free amine groups which were subsequently conjugated to Tat peptide, which acted as a delivery vector for nanosensor internalisation. Flow cytometry was used to confirm the health of MSC culture and assess the impact of nanosensor internalisation. MSC were characterised using fluorescently tagged CD cell surface markers that were also used to show that nanosensor internalisation did not negatively impact on MSC culture. Additionally it was shown that flow cytometry can be used to measure fluorophores located both on the cell surface and internalised within the cell. Complementary data was obtained using confocal microscopy to confirm nanosensor internalisation within MSC

	18646838, mproved cellular activity of antisense peptide nucleic acids by conjugation to a cationic peptide-lipid (CatLip) domain.Conjugation to cationic cell penetrating peptides (such as Tat, Penetratin, or oligo arginines) efficiently improves the cellular uptake of large hydrophilic molecules such as oligonucleotides and peptide nucleic acids, but the cellular uptake is predominantly via an unproductive endosomal pathway and therefore mechanisms that promote endosomal escape (or avoid the endosomal route) are required for improving bioavailability. A variety of auxiliary agents (chloroquine, calcium ions, or lipophilic photosensitizers) has this effect, but improved, unaided delivery would be highly advantageous in particular for future in vivo applications. We find that simply conjugating a lipid domain (fatty acid) to the cationic peptide (a CatLip conjugate) increases the biological effect of the corresponding PNA (CatLip) conjugates in a luciferase cellular antisense assay up to 2 orders of magnitude. The effect increases with increasing length of the fatty acid (C8-C16) but in parallel also results in increased cellular toxicity, with decanoic acid being optimal. Furthermore, the relative enhancement is significantly higher for Tat peptide compared to oligoarginine. Confocal microscopy and chloroquine enhancement indicates that the lipophilic domain increases the endosomal uptake as well as promoting significantly endosomal escape. These results provide a novel route for improving the (cellular) bioavailability of larger hydrophilic molecules

	18667497, argeting tat inhibitors in the assembly of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transcription complexes.Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transcription is regulated by the viral Tat protein, which relieves a block to elongation by recruiting an elongation factor, P-TEFb, to the viral promoter. Here, we report the discovery of potent Tat inhibitors that utilize a localization signal to target a dominant negative protein to its site of action. Fusing the Tat activation domain to some splicing factors, particularly to the Arg-Ser (RS) domain of U2AF65, creates Tat inhibitors that localize to subnuclear speckles, sites where pre-mRNA processing factors are stored for assembly into transcription complexes. A U2AF65 fusion named T-RS interacts with the nonphosphorylated C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) via its RS domain and is loaded into RNAP II holoenzyme complexes. T-RS is recruited efficiently to the HIV-1 promoter in a TAR-independent manner before RNAP II hyperphosphorylation but not to cellular promoters. The  preloading  of T-RS into HIV-1 preinitiation complexes prevents the entry of active Tat molecules, leaving the complexes in an elongation-incompetent state and effectively suppressing HIV-1 replication. The ability to deliver inhibitors to transcription complexes through the use of targeting/localization signals may provide new avenues for designing viral and transcription inhibitors

	18675778, ellular uptake and membrane-destabilising properties of alpha-peptide/beta-peptoid chimeras: lessons for the design of new cell-penetrating peptides.Novel peptidomimetic backbone designs with stability towards proteases are of interest for several pharmaceutical applications including intracellular delivery. The present study concerns the cellular uptake and membrane-destabilising effects of various cationic chimeras comprised of alternating N-alkylated beta-alanine and alpha-amino acid residues. For comparison, homomeric peptides displaying octacationic functionalities as well as the Tat(47-57) sequence were included as reference compounds. Cellular uptake studies with fluorescently labelled compounds showed that guanidinylated chimeras were taken up four times more efficiently than Tat(47-57). After internalisation, the chimeras were localised primarily in vesicular compartments and diffusively in the cytoplasm. In murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts, the chimeras showed immediate plasma membrane permeabilising properties, which proved highly dependent on the chimera chain length, and were remarkably different from the effects induced by Tat(47-57). Finally, biophysical studies on model membranes showed that the chimeras in general increase the permeability of fluid phase and gel phase phosphatidylcholine (PC) vesicles without affecting membrane acyl chain packing, which suggests that they restrict lateral diffusion of the membrane lipids by interaction with phospholipid head groups. The alpha-peptide/beta-peptoid chimeras described herein exhibit promising cellular uptake properties, and thus represent proteolytically stable alternatives to currently known cell-penetrating peptides

	18680158, yridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase, not pyridoxal kinase, involves in long-term potentiation induction in the rat dentate gyrus.In this study, we investigated whether the expression of pyridoxal kinase (PLK) and pyridoxine-5'-phosphate oxidase (PNPO) are altered following long-term potentiation (LTP) induction, and whether Tat-PLK and Tat-PNPO transductions affect LTP induction and paired-pulse responses in the rat dentate gyrus (DG). PNPO immunoreactivity was markedly increased in dentate granule cells after the induction of LTP, but that of PLK was not. Tat-PNPO (20 and 200 microg/kg), but not Tat-PLK or vitamin B6 precursors, treatments, increased the efficiency of high frequency stimulus-induced potentiation of populations spike amplitude when compared with saline-, or Tat-protein-treated animals. These changes correlated with the alterations in PNPO activity and its immunoreactivity. In addition, Tat-PNPO transduction increased paired-pulse facilitation but had no effect on the fast and late paired-pulse inhibitions. These findings suggest that PNPO may play a role in activity-dependent regulation of PLP level in the brain, which is involved in LTP induction and paired-pulse facilitation but not in enhancement of GABAergic inhibition

	18690739, hape effects of nanoparticles conjugated with cell-penetrating peptides (HIV Tat PTD) on CHO cell uptake.In order to probe the nanoparticle shape/size effect on cellular uptake, a spherical and two cylindrical nanoparticles, whose lengths were distinctively varied, were constructed by the selective cross-linking of amphiphilic block copolymer micelles. Herein, we demonstrate that, when the nanoparticles were functionalized with the protein transduction domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat protein (HIV Tat PTD), the smaller, spherical nanoparticles had a higher rate of cell entry into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells than did the larger, cylindrical nanoparticles. It was also found that nanoparticles were released after internalization and that the rate of cell exit was dependent on both the nanoparticle shape and the amount of surface-bound PTD

	18693018, esign and SAR of new substituted purines bearing aryl groups at N9 position as HIV-1 Tat-TAR interaction inhibitors.Twenty-four purine derivatives bearing aryl groups at N9 position were designed and synthesized as HIV-1 Tat-TAR interaction inhibitors. All the compounds showed high antiviral activities in inhibiting the formation of SIV-induced syncytium in CEM174 cells. Ten of them with low cytotoxicities were evaluated by Tat dependent HIV-1 LTR-driven CAT gene expression colorimetric enzyme assay in human 293T cells at a concentration of 30 microM, indicating effective inhibitory activities of blocking the Tat-TAR interaction. The aryl groups at N9 position affected the binding affinities between compounds and TAR RNA, showing some specificities of aryl groups to TAR RNA

	18710415, PARalpha and PPARgamma effectively protect against HIV-induced inflammatory responses in brain endothelial cells.Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear receptors which down-regulate inflammatory signaling pathways. Therefore, we hypothesized that alterations of PPAR functions can contribute to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)-induced dysfunction of brain endothelial cells. Indeed, treatment with HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein decreased PPAR transactivation in brain endothelial cells. We next stably over-expressed PPARalpha and PPARgamma in a newly developed cell line of human brain endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3 cells). Tat-induced up-regulation of inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, CCL2, and E-selectin were markedly attenuated in hCMEC/D3 over-expressing PPARalpha or PPARgamma. These results were confirmed in CCL2 and E-selectin promoter activity studies. Similar protective effects were observed in hCMEC/D3 after activation of PPARgamma by exogenous PPAR agonists (dPGJ(2) and rosiglitazone). PPAR over-expression also prevented Tat-induced binding activity and transactivation of nuclear factor-kappaB. Importantly, increased PPAR activity attenuated induction of IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, CCL2, and E-selectin in hCMEC/D3 cells co-cultured with HIV-1-infected Jurkat cells. The protective effects of PPAR over-expression were reversed by the antagonists of PPARalpha (MK886) or PPARgamma (GW9662). The present data suggest that targeting PPAR signaling may provide a novel therapeutic approach to attenuate HIV-1-induced local inflammatory responses in brain endothelial cells

	18721127, enetically modified adenoviral vector with the protein transduction domain of Tat improves gene transfer to CAR-deficient cells.The transduction efficiency of Ad (adenovirus) depends, to some extent, on the expression level of CAR (coxsackievirus and Ad receptor) of a target cell. The low level of CAR on the cell surface is a potential barrier to efficient gene transfer. To overcome this problem, PTD.AdeGFP (where eGFP is enhanced green fluorescent protein) was constructed by modifying the HI loop of Ad5 (Ad type 5) fibre with the Tat (trans-activating) PTD (protein transduction domain) derived from HIV. The present study showed that PTD.AdeGFP significantly improved gene transfer to multiple cell types deficient in expression of CAR. The improvement in gene transfer was not the result of charge-directed binding between the virus and the cell surface. Although PTD.AdeGFP formed aggregates, it infected target cells in a manner different from AdeGFP aggregates precipitated by calcium phosphate. In addition, PTD.AdeGFP was able to transduce target cells in a dynamin-independent pathway. The results provide some new clues as to how PTD.AdeGFP infects target cells. This new vector would be valuable in gene-function analysis and for gene therapy in cancer

	18781143, ell-permeable peptide Tat-PSD-95 PDZ2 inhibits chronic inflammatory pain behaviors in mice.Inflammatory conditions can lead to persistent debilitating pain, and the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) has been shown to play an important role in the processing of inflammatory pain. Postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), a scaffolding protein, has been identified to interact with NMDARs at neuronal synapses of the central nervous system (CNS). However, the role of these interactions in the central sensitization of nociceptive processing has not been defined. In this study, we investigated the effect of disrupting NMDAR/PSD-95 interactions on chronic inflammatory pain behaviors. We constructed a fusion peptide, Tat-PSD-95 PDZ2, comprising the second PDZ domain of PSD-95, to disrupt specifically NMDARs/PSD-95 protein interactions. Western blot analysis showed that Tat-PSD-95 PDZ2 intraperitoneally injected into mice was delivered intracellularly into neurons in the CNS. By in vitro and in vivo binding assays, we found that the Tat-PSD-95 PDZ2 dose dependently inhibited the interactions between NMDARs and PSD-95. Furthermore, behavioral testing showed that mice given Tat-PSD-95 PDZ2 exhibited significantly reduced complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced chronic inflammatory pain behaviors compared to the vehicle-treated group. Our results indicate that by disrupting NMDAR/PSD-95 protein interactions, the cell-permeable fusion peptide Tat-PSD-95 PDZ2 provides a new target and approach for chronic inflammatory pain therapy

	18828138, mmunoprevalence of the CD4+ T-cell response to HIV Tat and Vpr proteins is provided by clustered and disperse epitopes, respectively.Recent studies have suggested including nonstructural proteins as Tat and Vpr in HIV vaccines. However, little is known about the CD4+ T-cell response that these small proteins induce in humans. We have therefore evaluated these responses by in vitro priming experiments of CD4+ T lymphocytes harvested in healthy donors. In the Tat protein, only one peptide primed CD4+ T cells of eight HLA unrelated healthy donors. T cells induced by this peptide recognized immature DC loaded with the native Tat protein and are restricted by multiple HLA-DR molecules, in agreement with its binding capacity. This peptide was therefore processed in an appropriate manner and was highly immunoprevalent. CD4+ T-cell response to Vpr peptides was more disperse and involved six different peptides depending on the HLA-DR molecules of the donors. Two overlapping peptides were T-cell stimulating in at least half of the donors. T-cell response to Vpr in multiple donors is the result of a combination of several CD4+ T-cell epitopes with good to moderate immunoprevalence. Altogether, our results show that the frequency of responders to HIV Tat or Vpr proteins relies on one or multiple CD4+ T-cell epitopes, respectively

	18829756, pigenetic silencing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transcription by formation of restrictive chromatin structures at the viral long terminal repeat drives the progressive entry of HIV into latency.The molecular mechanisms utilized by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to enter latency are poorly understood. Following the infection of Jurkat T cells with lentiviral vectors that express Tat in cis, gene expression is progressively silenced. Silencing is greatly enhanced when the lentiviral vectors carry an attenuated Tat gene with the H13L mutation. Individual clones of lentivirus-infected cells showed a wide range of shutdown rates, with the majority showing a 50% silencing frequency between 30 to 80 days. The silenced clones characteristically contained a small fraction (0 to 15%) of activated cells that continued to express d2EGFP. When d2EGFP(+) and d2EGFP(-) cell populations were isolated from the shutdown clones, they quickly reverted to the original distribution of inactive and active cells, suggesting that the d2EGFP(+) cells arise from stochastic fluctuations in gene expression. The detailed analysis of transcription initiation and elongation using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays confirms that Tat levels are restricted in the latently infected cells but gradually rise during proviral reactivation. ChIP assays using clones of latently infected cells demonstrate that the latent proviruses carry high levels of deacetylated histones and trimethylated histones. In contrast, the cellular genes IkappaB alpha and GAPDH had high levels of acetylated histones and no trimethylated histones. The levels of trimethylated histone H3 and HP1-alpha associated with HIV proviruses fell rapidly after tumor necrosis factor alpha activation. The progressive shutdown of HIV transcription following infection suggests that epigenetic mechanisms targeting chromatin structures selectively restrict HIV transcription initiation. This decreases Tat production below the levels that are required to sustain HIV gene expression

	18829958, IV-1 clade-specific differences in the induction of neuropathogenesis.Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated dementia (HAD) is common among clade B HIV-infected individuals, but less common and less severe among individuals infected with clade C HIV-1, suggesting clade-specific differences in neuropathogenicity. Although differences in neuropathogenicity have been investigated in vitro using viral proteins responsible for HAD, to date there are no virological studies using animal models to address this issue. Therefore, we investigated neuropathogenesis induced by HIV-1 clades using the severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mouse HIV encephalitis model, which involves intracranial injection of macrophages infected with representative clade B (HIV-1(ADA)) or clade C (HIV-1(Indie-C1)) HIV-1 isolates into SCID mice. In cognitive tests, mice exposed to similar inputs of HIV-1 clade C made fewer memory errors than those exposed to HIV-1 clade B. Histopathological analysis of mice exposed to clade B exhibited greater astrogliosis and increased loss of neuronal network integrity. In vitro experiments revealed differences in a key characteristic of HIV-1 that influences HAD, increased monocyte infiltration. HIV-1(Indie-C1)-infected macrophages recruited monocytes poorly in vitro compared with HIV-1(ADA)-infected macrophages. Monocyte recruitment was HIV-1 Tat and CCL2 dependent. This is the first demonstration, ever since HIV neuropathogenesis was first recognized, that viral genetic differences between clades can affect disease severity and that such studies help identify key players in neuropathogenesis by HIV-1

	18837295, TL responses to regulatory proteins Tat and Rev in HIV-1 B'/C virus-infected individuals.OBJECTIVE: To characterize HIV-1 specific CTL responses to regulatory proteins Tat and Rev in HIV-B'/C virus-infected ART-naive individuals. METHODS: HIV-1-specific CTL responses were analyzed by IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay using overlapping peptides spanning the consensus sequences of HIV-1 clade C Tat and Rev proteins. Statistical analysis and graphical presentation were performed using SIGMAPLOT 10.0 and SIGMASTAT 3.5. For samples with a positive response, the magnitude of CTL responses was compared between HIV-1 C proteins by Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the significance threshold was P&lt;0.05. RESULTS: Tat and Rev were frequently recognized, with 23% and 52% of the tested individuals having detectable responses to these proteins, respectively. Several immunodominant regions were detected in Rev. No significant correlation was observed between the magnitude and breadth of CTL responses to regulatory proteins and the control of virus replication in this study. CONCLUSION: Tat and Rev can serve as targets for HIV-1-specific CTL, and several immunodominant regions are detectable in Rev. Further characterization of epitopes and their role in virus control may shed light on pathogenesis of HIV-1 natural infection and also be useful for the design and testing of candidate vaccines

	18852520, ctive component of Fatsia japonica enhances the transduction efficiency of Tat-SOD fusion protein both in vitro and in vivo.It has been reported that Tat-SOD can be directly transduced into mammalian cells and skin and acts as a potential therapeutic protein in various diseases. To isolate the compound that can enhance the transduction efficiency of Tat-SOD, we screened a number of natural products. 3-O-[beta-D-Glucopyranosyl(1--&gt;4)-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl]- hederagenin (OGAH) was identified as an active component of Fatsia japonica and is known as triterpenoid glycosides (hederagenin saponins). OGAH enhanced the transduction efficiencies of Tat-SOD into HeLa cells and mice skin. The enzymatic activities in the presence of OGAH were markedly increased in vitro and in vivo when compared with the controls. Although the mechanism is not fully understood, we suggest that OGAH, the active component of Fatsia japonica, might change the conformation of the membrane structure and it may be useful as an ingredient in antiaging cosmetics or as a stimulator of therapeutic proteins that can be used in various disorders related to reactive oxygen species (ROS)

	18979090, NA detection using peptide-inserted Renilla luciferase.A novel complementation system with short peptide-inserted-Renilla luciferase (PI-Rluc) and split-RNA probes was constructed for noninvasive RNA detection. The RNA binding peptides HIV-1 Rev and BIV Tat were used as inserted peptides. They display induced fit conformational changes upon binding to specific RNAs and trigger complementation or discomplementation of Rluc. Split-RNA probes were designed to reform the peptide binding site upon hybridization with arbitrarily selected target RNA. This set of recombinant protein and split-RNA probes enabled a high degree of sensitivity in RNA detection. In this study, we show that the Rluc system is comparable to Fluc, but that its detection limit for arbitrarily selected RNA (at least 100 pM) exceeds that of Fluc by approximately two orders of magnitude

	18988730, isualizing the dynamics of viral replication in living cells via Tat peptide delivery of nuclease-resistant molecular beacons.In this study, we describe the use of nuclease-resistant molecular beacons (MBs) for the real-time detection of coxsackievirus B6 replication in living Buffalo green monkey kidney (BGMK) cells via Tat peptide delivery. A nuclease-resistant MB containing 2'-O-methyl RNA bases with phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages was designed to specifically target an 18-bp 5' noncoding region of the viral genome. For intracellular delivery, a cell-penetrating Tat peptide was conjugated to the MB by using a thiol-maleimide linkage. Presence of the Tat peptide enabled nearly 100% intracellular delivery within 15 min. When the conjugate was introduced into BGMK cell monolayers infected with coxsackievirus B6, a discernible fluorescence was observed at 30 min after infection, and as few as 1 infectious viral particle could be detected within 2 h. The stability and the intracellular delivery properties of the modified MBs enabled real-time monitoring of the cell-to-cell spreading of viral infection. These results suggest that the Tat-modified, nuclease-resistant MBs may be powerful tools for improving our understanding of the dynamic behavior of viral replication and for therapeutic studies of antiviral treatments

	19007964, mall ruminant lentivirus Tat protein induces apoptosis in caprine cells in vitro by the intrinsic pathway.The small ruminant lentiviruses, caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV) and maedi visna virus (MVV) naturally cause inflammatory disease in goats and sheep, provoking chronic lesions in several different organs. We have previously demonstrated that in vitro infection of caprine cells by CAEV induces apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway (Rea-Boutrois, A., Pontini, G., Greenland, T., Mehlen, P., Chebloune, Y., Verdier, G. and Legras-Lachuer, C. 2008). In the present study, we used Tat deleted viruses and SLRV Tat-expression vectors to show that the SRLV Tat proteins are responsible for this apoptosis. We have also studied the activation of caspases-3, -8 and -9 by fluorescent assays in caprine cells expressing SRLV Tat proteins, and the effects of transfected dominant negative variants of these caspases, to show that Tat-associated apoptosis depends on activation of caspases-3 and -9, but not -8. A simultaneous disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential indicates an involvement of the mitochondrial pathway

	19011637, reatment of inflammatory and neuropathic pain by uncoupling Src from the NMDA receptor complex.Chronic pain hypersensitivity depends on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). However, clinical use of NMDAR blockers is limited by side effects resulting from suppression of the physiological functions of these receptors. Here we report a means to suppress pain hypersensitivity without blocking NMDARs, but rather by inhibiting the binding of a key enhancer of NMDAR function, the protein tyrosine kinase Src. We show that a peptide consisting of amino acids 40-49 of Src fused to the protein transduction domain of the HIV Tat protein (Src40-49Tat) prevented pain behaviors induced by intraplantar formalin and reversed pain hypersensitivity produced by intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant or by peripheral nerve injury. Src40-49Tat had no effect on basal sensory thresholds, acute nociceptive responses or cardiovascular, respiratory, locomotor or cognitive functions. Thus, through targeting of Src-mediated enhancement of NMDARs, inflammatory and neuropathic pain are suppressed without the deleterious consequences of directly blocking NMDARs, an approach that may be of broad relevance to managing chronic pain

	19013459, euronal survival and resistance to HIV-1 Tat toxicity in the primary culture of rat fetal neurons.In this study we report that primary cultures of rat fetal neurons contain subpopulations of cells that may be sensitive or resistant to HIV-1 Tat neurotoxicity. We demonstrate that rapid binding/uptake of Tat 1-86 for 2 h was sufficient to trigger caspase activation and neurodegeneration in rat fetal midbrain cell cultures. The uptake of Tat was followed by an increase in MCP1 (CCL2) immunoreactivity. Approximately 70% of neurons were able to survive transient or continuous (7 days) Tat exposure. The surviving neurons did not contain bound/internalized Tat, but were able to interact with Tat after medium replacement. These neurons were resistant to Tat toxicity. In neurons that resisted the toxic effects of continuous and repeated Tat treatment, levels of NR2A subunit of the NMDA receptor complex were significantly lower than in controls. We suggest that the subunit composition of NMDAR complexes may be important for the sensitivity of neurons to Tat toxicity

	19016855, ioenergetic requirements of a Tat-dependent substrate in the halophilic archaeon Haloarcula hispanica.Twin-arginine translocase (Tat) is involved in the translocation of fully folded proteins in a process that is driven by the proton motive force. In most prokaryotes, the Tat system transports only a small proportion of secretory proteins, and Tat substrates are often cofactor-containing proteins that require folding before translocation. A notable exception is found in halophilic archaea (haloarchaea), which are predicted to secrete the majority of their proteins through the Tat pathway. In this study, we have analysed the translocation of a secretory protein (AmyH) from the haloarchaeon Haloarcula hispanica. Using both in vivo and in vitro translocation assays, we demonstrate that AmyH transport is Tat-dependent, and, surprisingly, that its secretion does not depend on the proton motive force but requires the sodium motive force instead

	19029897, tructural insights into the cyclin T1-Tat-TAR RNA transcription activation complex from EIAV.The replication of many retroviruses is mediated by a transcriptional activator protein, Tat, which activates RNA polymerase II at the level of transcription elongation. Tat interacts with Cyclin T1 of the positive transcription-elongation factor P-TEFb to recruit the transactivation-response TAR RNA, which acts as a promoter element in the transcribed 5' end of the viral long terminal repeat. Here we present the structure of the cyclin box domain of Cyclin T1 in complex with the Tat protein from the equine infectious anemia virus and its corresponding TAR RNA. The basic RNA-recognition motif of Tat adopts a helical structure whose flanking regions interact with a cyclin T-specific loop in the first cyclin box repeat. Together, both proteins coordinate the stem-loop structure of TAR. Our findings show that Tat binds to a surface on Cyclin T1 similar to where recognition motifs from substrate and inhibitor peptides were previously found to interact within Cdk-cyclin pairs

	19049517, he twin-arginine translocation (Tat) systems from Bacillus subtilis display a conserved mode of complex organization and similar substrate recognition requirements.The twin arginine translocation (Tat) system transports folded proteins across the bacterial plasma membrane. In Gram-negative bacteria, membrane-bound TatABC subunits are all essential for activity, whereas Gram-positive bacteria usually contain only TatAC subunits. In Bacillus subtilis, two TatAC-type systems, TatAdCd and TatAyCy, operate in parallel with different substrate specificities. Here, we show that they recognize similar signal peptide determinants. Both systems translocate green fluorescent protein fused to three distinct Escherichia coli Tat signal peptides, namely DmsA, AmiA and MdoD, and mutagenesis of the DmsA signal peptide confirmed that both Tat pathways recognize similar targeting determinants within Tat signals. Although another E. coli Tat substrate, trimethylamine N-oxide reductase, was translocated by TatAdCd but not by TatAyCy, we conclude that these systems are not predisposed to recognize only specific Tat signal peptides, as suggested by their narrow substrate specificities in B. subtilis. We also analysed complexes involved in the second Tat pathway in B. subtilis, TatAyCy. This revealed a discrete TatAyCy complex together with a separate, homogeneous, approximately 200 kDa TatAy complex. The latter complex differs significantly from the corresponding E. coli TatA complexes, pointing to major structural differences between Tat complexes from Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. Like TatAd, TatAy is also detectable in the form of massive cytosolic complexes

	19089297, nhancement of cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity by dendritic cells loaded with Tat-protein transduction domain-fused hepatitis B virus core antigen.The protein transduction domain (PTD) of human immunodeficiency virus-1-Tat protein has a unique potency to penetrate the cellular membranes. To synthesize the sequence of Tat-PTD47-57 and hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBcAg), we spliced these sequences and linked a fusion gene into the pMAL-c2x vector. The fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography and pulsed with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs), and the transduction of recombinant protein was detected by immunofluorescence antibody assay. Results showed that recombinant PTD-HBcAg could penetrate into DC cytoplasm while recombinant HBcAg was detected on the surface of cells. The percentage of DC surface molecules, such as CD80, CD86 and major histocompatibility complex II, and production of cytokine (IL-12p70) induced by recombinant PTD-HBcAg were significantly higher than those induced by recombinant HBcAg or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. DCs treated with PTD-HBcAg induced T cells to differentiate into specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and enhanced the CTL killing response. In conclusion, the expressed and purified PTD-HBcAg fusion protein could penetrate into cells through the plasma membrane, promote DC maturation, and enhance T cells response to generate HBcAg-specific CTLs efficiently

	19182532, ultiple roles for Puralpha in cellular and viral regulation.Pur-alpha is a ubiquitous multifunctional protein that is strongly conserved throughout evolution, binds to both DNA and RNA and functions in the initiation of DNA replication, control of transcription and mRNA translation. In addition, it binds to several cellular regulatory proteins including the retinoblastoma protein, E2F-1, Sp1, YB-1, cyclin T1/Cdk9 and cyclin A/Cdk2. These observations and functional studies provide evidence that Puralpha is a major player in the regulation of the cell cycle and oncogenic transformation. Puralpha also binds to viral proteins such as the large T-antigen of JC virus (JCV) and the Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and plays a role in the cross-communication of these viruses in the opportunistic polyomavirus JC (JCV) brain infection, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The creation of transgenic mice with inactivation of the PURA gene that encodes Puralpha has revealed that Puralpha is critical for postnatal brain development and has unraveled an essential role of Puralpha in the transport of specific mRNAs to the dendrites and the establishment of the postsynaptic compartment in the developing neurons. Finally, the availability of cell cultures from the PURA knockout mice has allowed studies that have unraveled a role for Puralpha in DNA repair

	19195057, ell-permeable Tat-NBD peptide attenuates rat pancreatitis and acinus cell inflammation response.AIM: To investigate the effects of Tat-NEMO-binding domain (NBD) peptide on taurocholate-induced pancreatitis and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated AR42J acinus cells inflammatory response in rats. METHODS: Sodium taurocholate (5%) was used to induce the pancreatitis model. Forty-eight rats from the taurocholate group received an intravenous bolus of 13 mg/kg Tat-NBD (wild-type, WT) peptide, Tat-NBD (mutant-type, MT) peptide, NBD peptide or Tat peptide. The pancreatic histopathology was analyzed by hematoxylin staining. LPS was added to the culture medium to stimulate the AR42J cells. For pretreatment, cells were incubated with different peptides for 2 h before LPS stimulation. Expression of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha mRNA was analyzed using a semi-quantitative reverse-transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. IL-1beta and TNF-alpha protein in culture medium were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). NF-kappaB DNA-binding in pancreas was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. P65 expression of AR42J was determined by Strept Actividin-Biotin Complex (SABC) method. RESULTS: Pretreatment with Tat-NBD (WT) peptide at a concentration of 13 mg/kg body wt showed beneficial effect in pancreaitis model. LPS (10 mg/L) resulted in an increase of IL-1beta mRNA, IL-1beta protein, TNF-alpha mRNA and TNF-alpha protein, whereas significantly inhibitory effects were observed when cells were incubated with Tat-NBD (WT). Consisting with p65 expression decrease analyzed by SABC method, NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity significantly decreased in Tat-NBD (WT) pretreatment group, especially at the largest dose. No significant changes were found in the control peptide group. CONCLUSION: Our result supports that active NF-kappaB participates in the pathogenesis of STC-induced acute pancreatitis in rats. Tat-NBD (WT) peptide has anti-inflammatory effects in this model and inhibits the inflammation of acinus simulated by LPS

	19206074, ffects of dimerization of the cell-penetrating peptide Tat analog on antimicrobial activity and mechanism of bactericidal action.The cell-penetrating peptide Tat (48-60) (GRKKRRQRRRPPQ) derived from HIV-1 Tat protein showed potent antibacterial activity (MIC: 2-8 microM). To investigate the effect of dimerization of Tat (48-60) analog, [Tat(W): GRKKRRQRRRPWQ-NH(2)], on antimicrobial activity and mechanism of bactericidal action, its dimeric peptides, di-Tat(W)-C and di-Tat(W)-K, were synthesized by a disulfide bond linkage and lysine linkage of monomeric Tat(W), respectively. From the viewpoint of a weight basis and the monomer concentration, these dimeric peptides displayed almost similar antimicrobial activity against six bacterial strains tested but acted more rapidly against Staphylococcus aureus on kinetics of bactericidal activity, compared with monomeric Tat(W). Unlike monomeric Tat(W), these dimeric peptides significantly depolarized the cytoplasmic membrane of intact S. aureus cells at MIC and induced dye leakage from bacterial-membrane-mimicking egg yolk L-alpha-phosphatidylethanolamine/egg yolk L-alpha-phosphatidyl-DL-glycerol (7:3, w/w) vesicles. Furthermore, these dimeric peptides were less effective to translocate across lipid bilayers than monomeric Tat(W). These results indicated that the dimerization of Tat analog induces a partial change in the mode of its bactericidal action from intracellular target mechanism to membrane-targeting mechanism. Collectively, our designed dimeric Tat peptides with high antimicrobial activity and rapid bactericidal activity appear to be excellent candidates for future development as novel antimicrobial agents

	19223581, e>Tat acetylation modulates assembly of a viral-host RNA-protein transcription complex.HIV-1 Tat enhances viral transcription elongation by forming a ribonucleoprotein complex with transactivating responsive (TAR) RNA and P-TEFb, an elongation factor composed of cyclin T1 (CycT1) and Cdk9 that phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. Previous studies have shown that Lys-28 in the activation domain (AD) of Tat is essential for HIV-1 transcription and replication and is acetylated by p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), but the mechanistic basis of the Lys-28 requirement is unknown. Here, we show that Lys-28 acetylation modulates the affinity and stability of HIV-1 Tat-CycT1-TAR complexes by enhancing an interaction with the CycT1 Tat-TAR recognition motif. High-affinity assembly correlates strongly with stimulation of transcription elongation in vitro and Tat activation in vivo. In marked contrast, bovine lentiviral Tat proteins have evolved a high-affinity TAR interaction that does not require PCAF-mediated acetylation of the Tat AD or CycT1 for RNA binding, whereas HIV-2 Tat has evolved an intermediate mechanism that uses a duplicated TAR element and CycT1 to enhance RNA affinity and consequently transcription activation. The coevolution of Tat acetylation, CycT1 dependence, and TAR binding affinity is seen in viral replication assays using Tat proteins that rely on CycT1 for TAR binding but are acetylation deficient, where compensatory mutations rapidly accrue in TAR to generate high-affinity, CycT1-independent complexes reminiscent of the bovine viruses. Thus, lysine acetylation can be used to modulate and evolve the strength of a viral-host RNA-protein complex, thereby tuning the levels of transcription elongation

	19245529, enetic and biochemical properties of an alkaline phosphatase PhoX family protein found in many bacteria.We report on the biochemical, phylogenetic and genetic regulation of PhoX, the major alkaline phosphatase protein from the soil bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti. The protein is shown to be a member of a recently identified family of PhoX alkaline phosphatase proteins that is distinct from the well-characterized PhoA family. The mature S. meliloti PhoX protein is located in the periplasm and lacks a 76-amino-acid N-terminal Tat signal peptide. Its phosphatase activity was stimulated by Ca(+2) and was optimal at pH 9-11. Except for phytic acid and phosphatidic acid, the enzyme was active against a wide range of phosphorylated substrates (77 nucleotides, phosphorylated carbohydrates and amino acids) and thus exhibited low substrate specificity for C-O-P bonds. No C-P bond substrate was dephosphorylated while the protein was active with two of six phosphoramidate substrates (N-P bond) tested. Sinorhizobium meliloti phoX was induced when cells were starved for phosphorous and the induction was dependent on the PhoB-regulatory protein. We demonstrate by in vitro analysis that PhoB protein binds to two tandem 22 nt PhoB binding sites located 64-21 nt upstream from the phoX transcription start site. Analysis of 95 PhoX orthologues from diverse bacteria revealed two distinct phylogenetic groups of PhoX proteins. The two groups differed in having a conserved glycine (PhoX-I) or asparagine (PhoX-II) next to their putative catalytic Ca(+2) binding site. Analysis of the phoX promoter regions from many of these bacteria also revealed the presence of PhoB binding sites. Alkaline phosphatase proteins of either the PhoX or PhoA family (but rarely both) are found in many bacteria, thus it appears that these are functionally equivalent

	19268337, atently-infected CD4+ T cells are enriched for HIV-1 Tat variants with impaired transactivation activity.The ability of HIV to establish latent infection in CD4+ lymphocytes represents a major barrier to the eradication of HIV. It is not clear what mechanisms favor latent over productive infection, but prior studies have suggested a role for the viral transcription factor Tat or its RNA target, TAR. Using samples from five individuals who were started on ART within 6 months of infection and achieved a viral load &lt;50 (suppressed), we isolated one- and two-exon tat RNA from HIV propagated ex vivo from baseline plasma and from co-cultures of CD4+ T cells obtained at baseline and suppressed time points. Compared to virus from the baseline plasma (mostly from productively-infected CD4+ T cells), virus from the baseline and suppressed co-cultures (mostly from latently-infected cells) had more Tat variants with impaired transactivation activity. These findings suggest that impaired activity in the Tat-TAR axis may contribute to the establishment of latent infection in CD4+ T cells

	19278221, ndocytosis and membrane potential are required for HeLa cell uptake of R.I.-CKTat9, a retro-inverso Tat cell penetrating peptide.Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) can enter many types of cells and have become useful tools for introducing a variety of cargo such as exogenous peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids into cultured cells in vitro. Tat CPPs derived from the HIV-1 Tat protein are the most widely used among the arginine-rich CPPs. Even though CPPs hold considerable promise for drug delivery, poor biological stability and high in vivo clearance may limit their effectiveness for delivering cargo. Therefore, we utilize a retro-inverso form of a Tat peptide, R.I.-CKTat9, which is proteolytically stable. In the current study, the cellular entry mechanism of this arginine-rich CPP is investigated. Fluorescently labeled R.I.-CKTat9 entered HeLa cells in a concentration- and energy-dependent manner demonstrating both diffuse and punctate (vesicular) appearance inside the cells. The labeled R.I.-CKTat9 colocalized with labeled transferrin in the punctate structure, suggesting that the peptide enters HeLa cells by clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Incubation of cells with an isotonic/high K(+) buffer (KPBS) or an NH(4)Cl solution abolished the diffuse but not the punctate fluorescence, suggesting that membrane potential plays a critical role. This result also suggests that the flux originates from the endosome, not the extracellular space, and relies on the acidity of the endosome. Impairment of clathrin-mediated endocytosis by RNAi with clathrin heavy chain function and endocytosis inhibitors greatly reduced or completely abolished both diffuse and punctate fluorescence, further supporting a single route of endocytosis and subsequent endosomal escape. Since cells in the mitotic (M) phase shut down endocytosis but maintain plasma membrane potential, this property was used to further confirm the endocytic mechanism. Direct measurement of plasma membrane potential confirmed its persistence in M phase arrested HeLa cells. Consistent with our working hypothesis, these cells did not show any vesicular nor diffuse fluorescence of labeled R.I.-CKTat9, providing compelling evidence for the sequential steps of endocytosis and endosomal escape. Binding of labeled R.I.-CKTat9 to the surface of HeLa cells at 0 degrees C was reduced under the mildly acidic conditions of early endosomes, suggesting an acidity-dependent endosomal escape mechanism. Overall, these results indicate that both endocytosis and membrane potential are required for R.I.-CKTat9 entry into HeLa cells and suggest that translocation occurs at the endosomal membrane

	19327051, ifferential regulation of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) by HIV type 1 clade B and C Tat protein.Previous studies have demonstrated that infection with HIV-1 clades might differentially contribute to the neuropathogenesis of HIV-1-associated dementia (HAD). HIV-1 transactivator regulatory protein (Tat) plays a major role in the process of disruption of neuronal function. It is not well understood how these HIV-1 subtypes exert different neuropathogenic effects. Activation of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), the rate-limiting enzyme of the kynurenine pathway, leads to increased tryptophan catabolism and the generation of neurotoxins such as kynurenine (KYN). It is known that KYN plays a crucial role in the neuropathogenesis of HAD. We hypothesize that HIV-1 clade B and C Tat proteins might exert differential effects on human primary astrocytes by the upregulation of the IDO gene and protein expression as well as its activity and production of the neurotoxin KYN. RNA extracted from human primary astrocytes treated with either HIV-1 clade B and C Tat proteins was reverse transcribed and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR to determine IDO gene expression. In addition, the enzymatic activity of IDO and the concentration of KYN were measured in cell lysates and culture supernatants. Our results indicate that HIV-1 clade B Tat protein significantly upregulated the IDO gene and protein expression, IDO enzyme activity, as well as KYN concentration compared to HIV-1 clade C Tat protein. Thus, our studies for the first time demonstrate that HIV-1 clade B Tat protein in human primary astrocytes appears to increase the level of neuropathogenic agents, such as IDO and KYN, as compared to HIV-1 clade C Tat protein. These results provide further evidence that the prevalence of HAD may be correlated with the difference in clades of HIV-1

	19394064, ifferential patterns of immune escape at Tat-specific cytotoxic T cell epitopes in pigtail macaques.Cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses to conserved proteins such as Gag within HIV- or SIV-infected hosts can facilitate partial control of viremia. However, the utility of targeting variable viral proteins by CTL responses is unclear. We studied CTL responses to regulatory and accessory proteins of SIV in pigtail macaques. The regulatory and accessory proteins were the most commonly targeted proteins by CTL responses from pigtail macaques. We identified 2 novel Tat-specific CTL responses that were both restricted by the Mane-A10 allele. Viral escape at one of the Tat epitopes, KSA10, was slower in comparison to another Tat epitope KVA10. The kinetics of escape of the KSA10 Tat epitope were more similar to an immunodominant KP9 Gag epitope also restricted by Mane-A10. Our results suggest that some regulatory or accessory CTL epitopes may be useful targets for vaccination against HIV

	19429666, ndothelin-I and angiotensin II inhibit arterial voltage-gated K+ channels through different protein kinase C isoenzymes.AIMS: Voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels of arterial smooth muscle (ASM) modulate arterial tone and are inhibited by vasoconstrictors through protein kinase C (PKC). We aimed to determine whether endothelin-1 (ET-1) and angiotensin II (AngII), which cause similar inhibition of Kv, use the same signalling pathway and PKC isoenzyme to exert their effects on Kv and to compare the involvement of PKC isoenzymes in contractile responses to these agents. METHODS AND RESULTS: Kv currents recorded using the patch clamp technique with freshly isolated rat mesenteric ASM cells were inhibited by ET-1 or AngII. Inclusion of a PKCepsilon inhibitor peptide in the intracellular solution substantially reduced inhibition by AngII, but did not affect that by ET-1. Kv inhibition by ET-1 was reduced by the conventional PKC inhibitor Gö 6976 but not by the PKCbeta inhibitor LY333531. Selective peptide inhibitors of PKCalpha and PKCepsilon were linked to a Tat carrier peptide to make them membrane permeable and used to show that inhibition of PKCalpha prevented ET-1 inhibition of Kv current, but did not affect that by AngII. In contrast, inhibition of PKCepsilon prevented Kv inhibition by AngII but not by ET-1. The Tat-linked inhibitor peptides were also used to investigate the involvement of PKCalpha and PKCepsilon in the contractile responses of mesenteric arterial rings, showing that ET-1 contractions were substantially reduced by inhibition of PKCalpha, but unaffected by inhibition of PKCepsilon. AngII contractions were unaffected by inhibition of PKCalpha but substantially reduced by inhibition of PKCepsilon. CONCLUSION: ET-1 inhibits Kv channels of mesenteric ASM through activation of PKCalpha, while AngII does so through PKCepsilon. This implies that ET-1 and AngII target Kv channels of ASM through different pathways of PKC-interacting proteins, so each vasoconstrictor enables its distinct PKC isoenzyme to interact functionally with the Kv channel

	19466601, he heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) operates predominantly by blocking the mitochondrial-independent/extrinsic pathway of cellular apoptosis.Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) is a molecular chaperone protein which regulates cell apoptosis by interacting directly with the caspase activation components in the apoptotic pathways. With the assistance of the Tat protein transduction domain we directly delivered the Hsp27 into the myocardial cell line, H9c2 and demonstrate that this protein can reverse hypoxia-induced apoptosis of cells. In order to characterize the contribution of Hsp27 in blocking the two major apoptotic pathways operational within cells, we exposed H9c2 cells to staurosporine and cobalt chloride, agents that induce mitochondria-dependent (intrinsic) and -independent (extrinsic) pathways of apoptosis in cells respectively. The Tat-Hsp27 fusion protein showed a greater propensity to inhibit the effect induced by the cobalt chloride treatment. These data suggest that the Hsp27 predominantly exerts its protective effect by interfering with the components of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis

	19470243, nhibition of LPS-induced nitric oxide production by transduced Tat-arginine deiminase fusion protein in Raw 264.7 cells.Arginine deiminase (ADI), an arginine-degrading enzyme, has anti-proliferative and anti-tumor activities and is capable of inhibiting the production of nitric oxide (NO). Modulation of nitric oxide (NO) production is considered a promising approach for the treatment of various diseases including cancer, inflammation and neuronal disorders. In this study, an ADI gene was fused with an HIV-1 Tat peptide in a bacterial expression vector to produce an genetic in-frame Tat-ADI fusion protein. When added exogenously to the culture media, the expressed and purified Tat-ADI fusion proteins were efficiently transduced into macrophage Raw 264.7 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, transduced Tat-ADI fusion proteins markedly increased cell viability in cells treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This increase in viability was mediated by an inhibition of NO production. These results suggest that this Tat-ADI fusion protein can be used in protein therapies of NO-related disorders such as cancer, inflammation and neuronal diseases

	19472101, e>Tat-modified leptin is more accessible to hypothalamus through brain-blood barrier with a significant inhibition of body-weight gain in high-fat-diet fed mice.Obesity in human was found mainly due to the poor transportation of leptin through brain-blood barrier (BBB), called as leptin resistance. To produce a leptin capable of penetrating BBB, we have added Tat-PTD(9) to the C terminal of leptin to construct a fusion protein. The fusion Tat-leptin and native leptin genes were synthesized by single-step insertion of a polymerase chain reaction and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (Rosseta). The expressing products were purified and renatured by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, and identified by the molecular size in SDS-PAGE gel and by its immunoreactivity to specific antibody with Western-blotting assay. To bio-functionally evaluate the fusion protein, Balb/c mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD) were given Tat-leptin, leptin or saline for 19 days. The immunohistochemical staining showed the increases in positive stains for the leptin in the region of hypothalamus of the HFD mice with either Tat-leptin or leptin as compared to saline group, but the staining intensity and frequency in the group with Tat-leptin were stronger and higher than those in the group with leptin. Furthermore, the most efficiency in preventing the body-weight gain caused by HFD was found in Tat-leptin group among these three groups. These results suggest that Tat-modified leptin may become a great potential candidate for the prevention or therapy of obese patients

	19495967, etecting protein-protein interactions in living cells: development of a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assay to evaluate the PSD-95/NMDA receptor interaction.The PDZ domain mediated interaction between the NMDA receptor and its intracellular scaffolding protein, PSD-95, is a potential target for treatment of ischemic brain diseases. We have recently developed a number of peptide analogues with improved affinity for the PDZ domains of PSD-95 compared to the endogenous C-terminal peptide of the NMDA receptor, as evaluated by a cell-free protein-protein interaction assay. However, it is important to address both membrane permeability and effect in living cells. Therefore a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay was established, where the C-terminal of the NMDA receptor and PDZ2 of PSD-95 were fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and expressed in COS7 cells. A robust and specific BRET signal was obtained by expression of the appropriate partner proteins and subsequently, the assay was used to evaluate a Tat-conjugated peptide for its ability to disrupt the PSD-95/NMDA receptor interaction in living cells

	19526283, ole of Tat protein in HIV neuropathogenesis.The Tat protein of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of the neurocognitive deficits associated with HIV infection. This is the earliest protein to be produced by the proviral DNA in the infected cell. The protein not only drives the regulatory regions of the virus but may also be actively released from the cell and then interact with the cell surface receptors of other uninfected cells in the brain leading to cellular dysfunction. It may also be taken up by these cells and can then activate a number of host genes. The Tat protein is highly potent and has the unique ability to travel along neuronal pathways. Importantly, its production is not impacted by the use of antiretroviral drugs once the proviral DNA has been formed. This article reviews the pleomorphic actions of Tat protein and the evidence supporting its central role in the neuropathogenesis of the HIV infection

	19615365, ttenuated neurotoxicity of the transactivation-defective HIV-1 Tat protein in hippocampal cell cultures.This study reports that the cysteine 22--&gt;glycine 22 substitution in the HIV-1 Tat 1-86 B significantly attenuates its neurotoxicity. Consistent with previous studies, direct interactions of rat hippocampal cells with Tat 1-86 B were shown to cause dose-dependent and time-dependent neurotoxicity associated with activation of caspases from the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Despite the similar binding/uptake properties, Cys22 Tat 1-86 B failed to induce significant neurotoxicity and activation of caspases 9 and 3/7 in hippocampal primary cultures. Results of the study underscore the important role of cysteine-rich domain in mechanism of Tat-mediated neurotoxicity

	19657743, e>Tat peptide is capable of importing large nanoparticles across nuclear membrane in digitonin permeabilized cells.Understanding the capabilities and limitations of nuclear import is crucial to efficient delivery of macromolecules and nanoparticles for diagnosis and targeted therapy of diseases. Here we report the Tat peptide-mediated import of different cargos into cell nucleus, including dye-labeled streptavidin protein, 43 and 90 nm fluorescent beads, as well as approximately 20 nm quantum dots for kinetic measurements. Our results revealed significant differences between Tat- and NLS-mediated nuclear import: unlike delivery with the NLS, Tat peptide-based delivery is not inhibited by WGA blockage nor does it require ATP. Surprisingly, Tat peptide was able to import 90 nm beads into the nuclei of digitonin-permeabilized cells, suggesting that its interaction with the nuclear envelope follows a mechanism different from that of NLS. The import kinetics was quantified using Tat peptide-conjugated QDs, yielding a kinetic constant of 0.0085 s(-1). Taken together, our results suggest that, compared with NLS, Tat peptide-mediated nuclear import is faster, follows a different pathway, and is capable of importing large nanoparticles. These results have significant implications for the development of new approaches for delivery of cargo into the nuclei of living cells

	19659778, rotective anti-tumour immune responses by murine dendritic cells pulsed with recombinant Tat-carcinoembryonic antigen derived from Escherichia coli.Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is over-expressed on various human cancer cells and has been the target of immunotherapies using dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with CEA-specific RNA or peptides, or transduced by CEA-expressing adenovirus or vaccinia virus. Because activated DCs do not phagocytose soluble protein antigens efficiently and pure immature DCs are not obtained easily ex vivo, an efficacious whole CEA protein-loaded DC vaccine has not been reported. To improve the antigen delivery into DCs, we utilized CEA conjugated to a protein-transduction domain, human immunodeficiency virus transactivating Tat. Furthermore, we purified the truncated non-glycosylated CEA from Escherichia coli to overcome the safety concerns and immunosuppressive functions associated with the native CEA protein. Using confocal microscopy and fluorescence activating cell sorter analysis, we demonstrated that the Tat-CEA protein entered the cytoplasm of DCs efficiently within 10 min of co-culture, compared with the negligible amount of CEA into DCs 30 min later. CEA-specific T cell proliferation and cytotoxic T cell responses were enhanced significantly in mice immunized with Tat-CEA-pulsed DCs [DC (Tat-CEA)] compared with those immunized with CEA-pulsed DCs [DC (CEA)]. T helper type 1 responses were more prominent in the DC (Tat-CEA) immunized mice whose splenocytes secreted more interferon-gamma and less interleukin-4 than those from DC (CEA) immunized mice. In vivo, the DC (Tat-CEA) vaccine delayed tumour growth significantly and prolonged survival of tumour-bearing mice. These results suggest that protective epitopes are well preserved on bacteria-derived recombinant Tat-CEA. This strategy may provide a basic platform for DC-based anti-CEA vaccines that could be utilized in combination with advanced immune-enhancing therapeutics

	19671151, echanism of HIV-1 Tat RNA translation and its activation by the Tat protein.BACKGROUND: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein is a major viral transactivator required for HIV-1 replication. In the nucleus Tat greatly stimulates the synthesis of full-length transcripts from the HIV-1 promoter by causing efficient transcriptional elongation. Tat induces elongation by directly interacting with the bulge of the transactivation response (TAR) RNA, a hairpin-loop located at the 5'-end of all nascent viral transcripts, and by recruiting cellular transcriptional co-activators. In the cytoplasm, Tat is thought to act as a translational activator of HIV-1 mRNAs. Thus, Tat plays a central role in the regulation of HIV-1 gene expression both at the level of mRNA and protein synthesis. The requirement of Tat in these processes poses an essential question on how sufficient amounts of Tat can be made early on in HIV-1 infected cells to sustain its own synthesis. To address this issue we studied translation of the Tat mRNA in vitro and in human cells using recombinant monocistronic and dicistronic RNAs containing the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) of Tat RNA. RESULTS: This study shows that the Tat mRNA can be efficiently translated both in vitro and in cells. Furthermore, our data suggest that translation initiation from the Tat mRNA probably occurs by a internal ribosome entry site (IRES) mechanism. Finally, we show that Tat protein can strongly stimulate translation from its cognate mRNA in a TAR dependent fashion. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that Tat mRNA translation is efficient and benefits from a feedback stimulation by the Tat protein. This translational control mechanism would ensure that minute amounts of Tat mRNA are sufficient to generate enough Tat protein required to stimulate HIV-1 replication

	19733602, pecific transgene expression in HIV-infected cells using protease-cleavable transcription regulator.Gene therapy is a promising strategy for the treatment of HIV infection, but cell specificity remains an issue. Recently we have developed a new concept for a drug or gene delivery system responding to cellular signals (D-RECS) to achieve cell-specific transgene expression using a non-viral polymer-based vehicle. According to this concept, intracellular signaling enzymes, which are activated specifically in target cells, are used to trigger transgene expression. We previously applied this concept to HIV-1 protease and showed that the recombinant protease could act as a suitable signal. Here we further developed this system to achieve highly specific transgene expression in HIV-infected cells. We prepared a polymeric gene regulator grafted with a cationic peptide containing the HIV-Tat peptide via a specific substrate for HIV-1 protease. The regulator formed a stable polyplex with the transgene, suppressing its transcription. HIV-1 protease cleaved the peptide and released the transgene, which was consequently expressed specifically in activated HIV-infected cells, but remained unreleased and inactive in uninfected cells. The validity of this approach was further confirmed by applying it to the CVB1 2A protease of coxsackievirus (Picornaviridae family). This strategy should be widely applicable for specific expression of a variety of therapeutic genes in virus-infected cells

	19781962,  novel ultrasound microbubble carrying gene and Tat peptide: preparation and characterization.RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction is a promising technology for the targeted gene delivery. The purpose of the present study is to prepare a novel lipid ultrasound microbubble-carrying gene and transactivating transcriptional activator (Tat) peptide and to investigate its transfection effect in vivo. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Lipid ultrasound microbubbles were prepared using mechanical vibration, and the appearance, distribution, concentration, diameter, and zeta potential of the lipid ultrasound microbubbles were measured. The efficiencies of the microbubble carrying gene and Tat peptide were investigated using the fluorospectrophotometer. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography was performed on normal rabbits to observe the duration and intensity of enhancement in myocardium. Quantitative analysis was detected using the DFY Ultrasound Image Analyzer. Transfection in vivo was performed using the CGZZ ultrasound gene transfection instrument. The expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein in the organs was observed using confocal laser scanning microscope. RESULTS: The diameter of the lipid microbubbles carrying gene and Tat was (2.3 +/- 0.4) mum, the concentration was (3.1 +/- 0.4) x10(9)/mL, and Zeta potential was (2.0 +/- 0.1) mV. The gene encapsulation efficiency of the lipid ultrasound microbubbles was 32%, and the Tat encapsulation efficiency was 35%. In vivo experiment showed that lipid ultrasound microbubbles could enhance the echo intensity and transfection efficiency. CONCLUSION: Lipid microbubbles containing gene and Tat peptide can be used as a new vehicle for gene transfection

	19804722, rginine-rich peptides destabilize the plasma membrane, consistent with a pore formation translocation mechanism of cell-penetrating peptides.Recent molecular-dynamics simulations have suggested that the arginine-rich HIV Tat peptides translocate by destabilizing and inducing transient pores in phospholipid bilayers. In this pathway for peptide translocation, Arg residues play a fundamental role not only in the binding of the peptide to the surface of the membrane, but also in the destabilization and nucleation of transient pores across the bilayer. Here we present a molecular-dynamics simulation of a peptide composed of nine Args (Arg-9) that shows that this peptide follows the same translocation pathway previously found for the Tat peptide. We test experimentally the hypothesis that transient pores open by measuring ionic currents across phospholipid bilayers and cell membranes through the pores induced by Arg-9 peptides. We find that Arg-9 peptides, in the presence of an electrostatic potential gradient, induce ionic currents across planar phospholipid bilayers, as well as in cultured osteosarcoma cells and human smooth muscle cells. Our results suggest that the mechanism of action of Arg-9 peptides involves the creation of transient pores in lipid bilayers and cell membranes

	19811073, ell-type-specific proteome and interactome: using HIV-1 Tat as a test case.HIV-1 is a small retrovirus that wreaks havoc on the human immune system. It is a puzzle to the scientific community how a virus that encodes only nine proteins can take complete control of its host and redirect the cell to complete replication or maintain latency when necessary. One way to explain the control elicited by HIV-1 is through numerous protein partners that exist between viral and host proteins, allowing HIV-1 to be intimately involved in virtually every aspect of cellular biology. In addition, we postulate that the complexity exerted by HIV-1 can not merely be explained by the large number of protein-protein interactions documented in the literature but, rather, cell-type-specific interactions and post-translational modifications of viral proteins must be taken into account. We use HIV-1 Tat and its influence on viral transcription as an example of cell-type-specific complexity. The influence of post-translational modifications (acetylation and methylation), as well as subcellular localization on Tat binding partners, is also discussed

	19860923, omparative functional analysis of Jembrana disease virus Tat protein on lentivirus long terminal repeat promoters: evidence for flexibility at its N-terminus.BACKGROUND: Jembrana disease virus (JDV) encodes a potent regulatory protein Tat that strongly stimulates viral expression by transactivating the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. JDV Tat (jTat) promotes the transcription from its own LTR as well as non-cognate LTRs, by recruiting host transcription factors and facilitating transcriptional elongation. Here, we compared the sequence requirements of jTat for transactivation of JDV, bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) LTRs. RESULTS: In this study, we identified the minimal protein sequence for LTR activation using jTat truncation mutants. We found that jTat N-terminal residues were indispensable for transactivating the HIV LTR. In contrast, transactivation of BIV and JDV LTRs depended largely on an arginine-rich motif and some flanking residues. Competitive inhibition assay and knockdown analysis showed that P-TEFb was required for jTat-mediated LTR transactivation, and a mammalian two-hybrid assay revealed the robust interaction of jTat with cyclin T1. In addition, HIV LTR transactivation was largely affected by fusion protein at the jTat N-terminus despite the fact that the cyclin T1-binding affinity was not altered. Furthermore, the jTat N-terminal sequence enabled HIV Tat to transactivate BIV and JDV LTRs, suggesting the flexibility at the jTat N-terminus. CONCLUSION: This study showed the distinct sequence requirements of jTat for HIV, BIV and JDV LTR activation. Residues responsible for interaction with cyclin T1 and transactivation response element are the key determinants for transactivation of its cognate LTR. N-terminal residues in jTat may compensate for transactivation of the HIV LTR, based on the flexibility

	19881308, reparation of an artificial cell cycle progressor with a novel mechanism.Control of cell cycle progression in somatic cells or terminally differentiated cells is a key technology for cell-based therapies such as regenerative therapy. We have prepared an artificial cell cycle progression peptide composed of a human immunodeficiency virus-derived Tat protein transduction domain (PTD) and a p53 genetic suppressor element (GSE123). The peptide significantly promoted hepatocyte growth factor-induced DNA synthesis and the proliferation of primary mouse hepatocytes, which are highly differentiated somatic cells. The addition of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence to the peptide increased the internalization of the peptide to the nuclear fraction. Distribution analysis using a fluoresein isothiocyanate-labeled peptide indicated that the NLS enabled the peptide to escape from the lysosomes to the cytosol. As a result, the NLS-Tat-GSE123 peptide induced potent cell proliferation of primary mouse hepatocytes in vitro. The use of this peptide as an artificial cell growth enhancer, bypassing a specific receptor, is a useful tool for the study of regenerative therapy and cell signaling

	19901984, otent inhibition of HIV-1 replication by a Tat mutant.Herein we describe a mutant of the two-exon HIV-1 Tat protein, termed Nullbasic, that potently inhibits multiple steps of the HIV-1 replication cycle. Nullbasic was created by replacing the entire arginine-rich basic domain of wild type Tat with glycine/alanine residues. Like similarly mutated one-exon Tat mutants, Nullbasic exhibited transdominant negative effects on Tat-dependent transactivation. However, unlike previously reported mutants, we discovered that Nullbasic also strongly suppressed the expression of unspliced and singly-spliced viral mRNA, an activity likely caused by redistribution and thus functional inhibition of HIV-1 Rev. Furthermore, HIV-1 virion particles produced by cells expressing Nullbasic had severely reduced infectivity, a defect attributable to a reduced ability of the virions to undergo reverse transcription. Combination of these inhibitory effects on transactivation, Rev-dependent mRNA transport and reverse transcription meant that permissive cells constitutively expressing Nullbasic were highly resistant to a spreading infection by HIV-1. Nullbasic and its activities thus provide potential insights into the development of potent antiviral therapeutics that target multiple stages of HIV-1 infection

	20060860, mproved Tat-mediated plasmid DNA transfer by fusion to LK15 peptide.The use of cell penetrating peptides (CPPs), such as Tat-derived peptide, to deliver DNA into cells is limited as evidenced by the low transfection efficiency of their DNA complexes. Here, we demonstrate that covalent attachment of membrane active peptide LK15 to Tat peptide improves gene transfer. Our results demonstrate that Tat peptide was able to form complexes with DNA, but their transfection efficiency was insufficient as assessed by luciferase assay. The attachment of LK15 to Tat significantly improved the physiochemical properties of the DNA complexes, rendered the complexes membrane active and enhanced the gene expression in HT29 and in HT1080 cultured cells. The enhanced transfection ability of Tat-LK15 compared to Tat is likely to be due mainly to the higher uptake of DNA. Finally, we evaluated the penetration and transfection ability of Tat and Tat-LK15 in multicellular tumour spheroids (MCTS) to mimic in vivo delivery to tumours. The results showed that the penetration and transfection ability of Tat and Tat-LK15/DNA complexes were limited to the rim of HT29 spheroids. Taken together, our data shows improvement in the transfection efficiency of Tat peptide by covalent attachment to LK15. Further advancements are needed before any potential applications in tissues as the penetration into the core of MCTS remains severely restricted

	20084437, tudy on the intracellular fate of Tat peptide-conjugated quantum dots by spectroscopic investigation.The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of water-soluble thiol-capped CdTe quantum dots (QDs) conjugated with Tat peptide in solution showed a remarkable redshift as compared to that of unconjugated QDs. After cellular uptake of the Tat-QDs conjugates, the micro-PL spectrum of Tat-QDs in lysosomes showed a spectral blueshift, which was most probably due to the fact that Tat peptide was digested by the enzymes, leaving the Tat-detached QDs in lysosomes. The reasons for the spectral changes have been discussed in detail

	20149443, EG-PLA microparticles for encapsulation and delivery of Tat-EGFP to retinal cells.The efficient and controlled delivery of genes and proteins to retinal cells remains a challenge. In this study, we evaluated polyethylene glycol-polylactic acid (PEG-PLA) microparticles for encapsulation and delivery of a Transactivator of transcription-enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion (Tat-EGFP) to retinal cells. Our main objective was to develop a microparticle system that delivers Tat-EGFP with an initial rapid release (within 24 h) followed by a sustained release. We prepared four different formulations of Tat-EGFP encapsulated PEG-PLA particles to investigate the effects of protein and polymer concentrations on particle morphology and protein release, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorometry techniques. The optimum formulation was selected based on higher protein release, and smaller particle size. The optimum formulation was then tested in vitro for cell biocompatibility and protein internalization, and in vivo for cellular toxicity following sub-retinal injections into rat eyes. The results suggest that PEG-PLA microparticles can deliver proteins in cell culture allowing protein internalization in as little as 1 h. In vivo, protein was shown to localize within the photoreceptor layer of the retina, and persist for at least 9 weeks with no observed toxicity

	9176513, tudies on the effect of the combined expression of anti-tat and anti-rev genes on HIV-1 replication.A series of retroviral vectors with potential anti-tat and antirev activity was developed. Vectors containing a tat transdominant negative mutant (tat22/37) and an RRE decoy in different positions, directed by the same promoter or by different promoters, were generated. Retroviral vectors containing tat22/37 and the RevM10 transdominant negative mutant were also constructed. Jurkat cells were transduced with the recombinant retroviruses to produce monoclonal and polyclonal cultures. In these cell lines the recombinant proviruses were correctly integrated and expression of the inserted genes was detected by Northern blot or RT-PCR analysis. However, infection of these cell lines with HIV-1 showed that none of these recombinant constructs inhibited virus replication at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI). At a low MOI, two cell clones containing tat22/37 and the RRE decoy in 3' position showed a long lasting protection against virus replication, in comparison to control cultures expressing tat22/37 or RRE alone. Combination of tat and rev mutants was ineffective in inhibiting HIV-1 replication at both low and high MOIs. At a low MOI, HIV-1 replication was efficiently blocked in two cell clones expressing the RevM10 mutant alone. These results show a synergic effect of anti-tat and anti-rev molecules when the RRE sequence is cloned 3' to tat22/37, suggesting the possibility of using this vector design to control HIV-1 replication

	9191845, ctivity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 promoter/TAR regions and tat1 genes derived from individuals with different rates of disease progression.Different rates of disease progression may be associated with different human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) promoter and/or transactivator activities. We therefore analyzed the sequences and activities of the first exon of Tat, tat1, and the promoter/trans-acting responsive (TAR) regions amplified directly from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from five long-term nonprogressors and eight progressing HIV-1-infected individuals. The majority of tat1 alleles and promoter/TAR regions from all patients were intact and showed comparable activities in transient reporter assays. A substantial number of point mutations and some length variations were observed in the promoter/TAR region. In a single nonprogressor, the Sp1 binding site 3 was consistently altered and the transcriptional activity in the presence of Tat was diminished. Some LTR clones from a rapid progressor contained a fourth Sp1 binding site, which was associated with an elevated basal promoter activity. These data suggest that defects in the promoter/TAR region or tat1 are rare and that different promoter/transactivator activities are not commonly associated with different progression rates

	9261187, ranslation of an uncapped mRNA involves scanning.tat, an essential gene of human immunodeficiency virus, when placed under the control of the RNA polymerase III promoter from the adenovirus VA RNA1 gene, is transcribed into an uncapped and nonpolyadenylated mRNA. This VA-Tat RNA is translated to produce functional Tat protein in transfected mammalian cells (Gunnery, S., and Mathews, M. B. (1995) Mol. Cell. Biol. 15, 3597-3607). The presence of an upstream open reading frame (ORF) in VA-Tat RNA is inhibitory to the translation of the Tat ORF, suggesting that the RNA is scanned during translation even though it is uncapped. Because the effect of the upstream ORF is relatively small (about 2-fold), we sought more definitive evidence of scanning by introducing secondary structures of varying stabilities into the 5'-untranslated region of VA-Tat RNA. The results of transfection experiments showed that highly stable secondary structure was inhibitory to Tat synthesis, whereas structures of lower stability were not inhibitory, confirming that uncapped mRNA is subject to scanning. Furthermore, translation of the downstream ORF was reduced but not eliminated by mutations that caused the upstream ORF to overlap the Tat ORF. Extending the overlap of the two ORFs further decreased the translation of the downstream ORF. This observation implies that ribosomes reinitiate after termination, possibly after migrating in a 3' to 5' direction through the overlap region of the mRNA. Similar results were obtained with a capped polymerase II transcript, indicating that the translation of polymerase II and polymerase III transcripts occurs through similar mechanisms

	9266985, inetics of viral RNA synthesis following cell-to-cell transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.The temporal appearance and levels of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) tat, rev, nef, env and gag mRNA species were examined using a synchronized, one-step, cell-to-cell HIV-1 infection model involving HUT-78 cells and HIV- 1 persistently infected H3B cells. Individual mRNAs were quantified by RT-PCR using RNA standards transcribed in vitro from cDNA clones. Consistent with an infection that produces high yields of virus, significant levels of env and gag mRNAs were detected in the cytoplasm of infected cells late in the infection cycle. However, at no time after infection did levels of tat, rev and nef mRNA, which encode the regulatory proteins of HIV-1, exceed their levels present in the persistently infected virus donor H3B cells. The absence of early phase induction of these mRNAs is in contrast to what is observed in cell-free HIV-1 infections or in PMA-stimulated HIV-1 chronically infected cell lines. Our results suggest that tat and rev mRNAs are already present in the cytoplasm of the persistently infected virus donor cells at levels sufficient for initiation and establishment of a highly productive infection in HIV-1 fusion-mediated infected cells. Thus, lack of sufficient Tat and Rev proteins is not likely to be the limiting factor for virus production in H3B cells, nor is increased production of these proteins likely to be the cause of the increased virus production seen following cell-to-cell transmission

	9299621, nvolvement of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 splice sites in the cytoplasmic accumulation of viral RNA.To define the role of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 splice sites in the cytoplasmic accumulation of viral RNAs, sequential deletion mutagenesis on an infectious proviral clone of HIV-1 was performed. Deletion of the majority of intron sequences, containing previously identified CRS, did not attenuate CRS activity. Retention of either the first or second tat intron preserved CRS activity. RNAs containing splice donor sequences, in the absence of known downstream splice acceptor sequences, retained CRS activity. Unexpectedly, these splice donors were still utilized for splicing. These results indicate that the major HIV-1 splice donors can function as CRS and function to negatively regulate the cytoplasmic accumulation of HIV-1 RNAs in COS cells

	9311879, eutralization sensitivity of cell culture-passaged simian immunodeficiency virus.CEMx174- and C8166-45-based cell lines which contain a secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter gene under the control of a tat-responsive promoter derived from either SIVmac239 or HIV-1(NL4-3) were constructed. Basal levels of SEAP activity from these cell lines were low but were greatly stimulated upon transfection of tat expression plasmids. Infection of these cell lines with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) resulted in a dramatic increase in SEAP production within 48 to 72 h that directly correlated with the amount of infecting virus. When combined with chemiluminescent measurement of SEAP activity in the cell-free supernatant, these cells formed the basis of a rapid, sensitive, and quantitative assay for SIV and HIV infectivity and neutralization. Eight of eight primary isolates of HIV-1 that were tested induced readily measurable SEAP activity in this system. While serum neutralization of cloned SIVmac239 was difficult to detect with other assays, neutralization of SIVmac239 was readily detected at low titers with this new assay system. The neutralization sensitivities of two stocks of SIVmac251 with different cell culture passage histories were tested by using sera from SIV-infected monkeys. The primary stock of SIVmac251 had been passaged only twice through primary cultures of rhesus monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells, while the laboratory-adapted stock had been extensively passaged through the MT4 immortalized T-cell line. The primary stock of SIVmac251 was much more resistant to neutralization by a battery of polyclonal sera from SIV-infected monkeys than was the laboratory-adapted virus. Thus, SIVmac appears to be similar to HIV-1 in that extensive laboratory passage through T-cell lines resulted in a virus that is much more sensitive to serum neutralization

	9436754, n vitro selection of HIV-1 resistant to an anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody that inhibits virus transcription.Phase I studies using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to the Ig-CDR3-like loop in domain 1 of CD4 (e.g., 13B8-2 mAb) have already been documented for HIV-1-infected patients. In vitro, such mAbs do not inhibit virus to cell fusion but are able to inhibit virus envelope-mediated syncytia formation. Moreover, these mAbs inhibit Tat-induced activation of HIV-1 promoter and HIV-1 transcription in infected CD4+ cells. Here, we report the selection of escaped mutant virus or viruses derived from HIV-1Lai capable of replicating in vitro in the presence of concentrations of 13B8-2 mAb, that usually inhibit HIV-1Lai particle production. The escaped mutant virus or viruses, termed HIV-1Lai13EM, kept the major enzymatic restriction sites found in HIV-1Lai and remained sensitive to anti-CD4 mAb-, soluble CD4-, and recombinant gp120-mediated inhibition of syncytia formation. Possible genetic changes affecting the tat gene or the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) were investigated. Partial sequence analysis of HIV-1Lai13EM and a control HIV-1Lai grown for 85 days in CEM cells, demonstrated that the first tat exon of these two viruses encoded identical proteins. Although a point mutation G&gt;A was frequently encountered (6 of 13 sequences) in the LTRs of HIV-1Lai13EM at position -188 within the negative regulatory element (NRE), this mutation did not confer the escape mutant phenotype. Our study indicates that the mutant phenotype probably requires genetic changes in a region or regions outside the LTRs

	9445075, utations in the tat gene are responsible for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 postintegration latency in the U1 cell line.Previous reports have demonstrated that the U1 cell line, a model for postintegration latency, is defective at the level of Tat function and can be rescued by exogenously provided Tat protein. Sequence analysis of tat cDNAs from the U1 cell line identified two distinct forms of Tat, in agreement with the fact that this cell line contains two integrated human immunodeficiency (HIV) proviruses. One Tat cDNA lacked an ATG initiation codon, while the other contained an H-to-L mutation at amino acid 13 (H13--&gt;L). Both tat cDNAs were defective in terms of transcriptional activation of long terminal repeat-luciferase reporter gene in transient-transfection experiments. Introduction of the H13--&gt;L mutation in a wild-type tat background caused a severe reduction in transcriptional activation. Introduction of the same mutation in an infectious HIV molecular clone caused a severely defective phenotype which could be rescued when the HIV proviral DNA was transfected in a Jurkat cell line stably expressing the Tat protein (Jurkat-Tat) or in Jurkat cells treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha. Infectious virus stocks generated in Jurkat-Tat cells were used to infect Jurkat cells and exhibited severely impaired growth which could also be rescued by infecting Jurkat-Tat cells. These observations define tat mutations as a mechanism for HIV postintegration latency

	9445814, Effects of the nef and tat genes of the human immunodeficiency virus type I on rodent cells in vivo and in vitro]The tat and nef regulatory genes of the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) under the control of eukaryotic promoters were transferred in vivo into mice and in vitro into rat cell cultures. The development was disturbed and adenocarcinomas of the lacrimal glands and pancreas appeared in transgenic mice carrying the HIV-1 tat gene. Transfection with the tat gene altered morphology and increased proliferative activity of Rat-2 pseudonormal cells. The tat gene also induced the formation of neoplastic foci in a primary rat embryo fibroblast culture. The results obtained showed that the HIV-1 tat gene can act as an oncogene and activate the proliferation of cultured cells. Cell proportions in peripheral blood and bone marrow were altered and mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation was decreased in transgenic mice carrying the HIV-1 nef gene. This gene also significantly suppressed proliferation but had no effect on morphology of Rat-2 cells. Thus, the HIV-1 nef gene appeared to suppress proliferation of various animal cells

	9472557, evelopment of replicative and nonreplicative hepatitis B virus vectors.To investigate the possibility of using hepatitis B virus (HBV) as a vector, the tat gene from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was inserted into the full-length HBV genome in-frame with the polymerase (pol) open reading frame in the tether region and downstream of the preS1 promoter. We demonstrated that the tat gene was expressed with full activity in transactivating the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). The expression of the tat gene in the context of the HBV genome in chicken hepatoma and human cervical carcinoma cells, however, was not as efficient as that in human hepatoblastoma cells, which reflects the cellular and species specificity of promoters of hepadnaviruses. Detection of RNA expressed from this HBVtat recombinant revealed transcription of the tat gene by two promoters: the core/pol promoter and the preS1 promoter. A Pol-Tat fusion protein expressed by the core/pol promoter did not seem to contribute to the tat transactivation activity of the HBVtat recombinant since a frameshift mutation in the pol gene did not affect the recombinant tat function. The functional tat protein, therefore, was most likely expressed as a Tat-Pol fusion product. Endogenous polymerase assays showed that the pol protein expressed from the HBVtat recombinant was still active although at a reduced level. Hepatitis B surface antigens and e antigen produced from this recombinant were detected at similar levels as those produced from the wild type. Notably, the capability of forming complete HBV particles was still retained. These studies indicate the potential of constructing HBV as a replicative vector. We also showed that manipulation of a nonreplicative HBV vector was possible. Expression of the HBV polymerase could be completely eliminated and replication of the nonreplicative HBV recombinant could be supported by Pol transcomplementation

	9505976, etection of bovine immunodeficiency-like virus infection in experimentally infected calves.Detection of BIV virus infection by serological means, PCR and virus isolation in experimentally infected calves is described. Viral sequences were specifically detected by PCR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), with primer systems located in the gag, pol and tat regions of the viral genome. An enzyme-linked oligosorbent assay (ELOSA) in microtiter plates is described, for the detection of PCR products, the sensitivity of which was shown to be comparable to that of membrane hybridization detection. Serological response of the animals against the BIV p26 protein was shown, using a recombinant fusion protein ((His)6p26) expressed in E. coli and purified by metal affinity chromatography, in ELISA and Western blot studies. The presence of infectious virus was demonstrated by its rescue, by virus isolation in cell cultures, from PBMCs during a one year follow-up

	9514931, nteraction of the second coding exon of Tat with human EF-1 delta delineates a mechanism for HIV-1-mediated shut-off of host mRNA translation.HIV-1 Tat has pleiotropic functions. While its most studied role is to activate transcription from the retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR)-promoter, Tat also has functions as a secretable growth factor, a T-cell activator, and an inducer of cellular apoptosis, amongst others. For its transcriptional function, the first coding exon of Tat appears wholly sufficient; however, lentiviruses (HIVs and SIVs) maintain and conserve a second coding exon for Tat. While the function(s) of the second exon of Tat has remained largely unknown, its integrity in lentiviral genomes suggests biological importance, possibly a role in non-transcriptional activities. To understand better the biology of the second exon of Tat in HIV-1 infection of cells, we have searched for cellular proteins that bind specifically to this protein domain. Here, we report that the human translation elongation factor 1-delta (EF-1 delta) binds to the second exon of HIV-1 Tat. Interaction between Tat and EF-1 delta dramatically reduces the efficiency of the translation of cellular, but not viral, mRNAs. These findings suggest that a non-transcriptional activity of Tat modulates cellular protein synthesis, thereby affecting the metabolism of host cells

	9520165, uman cytomegalovirus product UL44 downregulates the transactivation of HIV-1 long terminal repeat.OBJECTIVE: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is often isolated from HIV-1-infected patients and the two viruses can infect the same cell type giving rise to direct bidirectional interactions. Whereas the long terminal repeat (LTR) transactivation ability of HCMV immediate early gene (IE1/IE2) is well documented, no information is available on the possible role of other HCMV proteins. In this study, the activity of ppUL44, an early DNA-binding protein, on HIV LTR transactivation was investigated. METHODS: HIV LTR transactivation by ppUL44 in presence or absence of HIV-1 Tat and HCMV IE1/IE2 was determined in J-Jhan and U973 cells through transient transfection experiments with a series of different expression vectors. Some experiments were also performed on U373-MG astrocytoma cells permanently transfected with UL44 or with another HCMV gene used as a control (UL55). RESULTS: The basal transactivation activity of the HIV LTR was not influenced by the presence of ppUL44. On the contrary, the transactivation observed in the presence of Tat, IE1/IE2 or both factors in synergy was strongly downregulated by ppUL44 in a dose-dependent manner. Deletion constructs of ppUL44 demonstrated that the region of the molecule responsible for the inhibition of the LTR is located within the last 114 amino acids at the carboxyl-terminal region. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained indicate that within the last 114 amino acids of ppUL44 there is a domain that has a negative effect on the ability of HIV-1 LTR to be activated by both its autologous transactivator Tat and the heterologous transactivator HCMV IE1/IE2 functioning individually or synergistically

	9581978, nterplay between positive and negative elongation factors: drawing a new view of DRB.DRB is a classic inhibitor of transcription by RNA polymerase II (pol II). Although it has been demonstrated that DRB inhibits the elongation step of transcription, its mode of action has been elusive. DRB also markedly inhibits human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transcription, by targeting the elongation which is enhanced by the HIV-encoded transactivator Tat. Two factors essential for DRB action have recently been identified. These factors, positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) and DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF), positively and negatively regulate pol II elongation, and are likely to be relevant to the function of Tat. In this review, we summarize the recent findings on these factors, and discuss a possible model for the molecular mechanism of DRB action

	9650613, reclinical characterization of an anti-tat ribozyme for therapeutic application.A hammerhead ribozyme retroviral construct, denoted RRz2, targeting the coding region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) tat gene, has shown itself to be effective in a range of test systems. Inhibition of the replication of HIV-1 IIIB and primary drug-resistant strains in pooled transduced CEMT4 cells was consistently found to be more than 80% compared with the control-vector transduced cells, whereas a mutant RRz2 gave approximately 45% inhibition. A multiple HIV-1 passage assay showed the absence of emergence of mutations within the specific viral RNA ribozyme target sequences. This lack of generation of ribozyme  escape mutants  occurred despite the almost complete disappearance of a HIV-1 quasi-species in the testing virus. When RRz2 was tested in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from HIV-1-infected patients, paired analysis showed that cell viability in the ribozyme-transduced HIV-1-infected PBLs was significantly higher than that in the vector-transduced cells. This difference in viability (vector versus RRz2) was not observed in PBLs from non-HIV-1-infected donors. Taken together, these results indicate that the transfer of an anti-HIV-1 ribozyme gene into human T lymphocytes could have major impact on viral replication and T cell viability in the HIV-1-infected individual

	9718130, rain-derived HIV-1 tat sequences from AIDS patients with dementia show increased molecular heterogeneity.HIV-1 infection results in a dementing illness affecting 20% of patients with AIDS. Several HIV-1 genes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of HIV-induced neurological disease. To search for distinct HIV-1 sequences associated with the development of dementia, brain-derived tat, env, and pol sequences were examined from AIDS patients defined pre-mortem as demented (HIV-D)[n=5] or non-demented (HIV-ND)[n=5]. Estimations of evolutionary distances and frequency of non-synonymous mutation rates revealed significant differences between brain-derived tat, env, and pol-encoded reverse transcriptase sequences. However, established zidovudine-associated resistance mutations in reverse transcriptase sequences were identified in only one HIV-D and one HIV-ND patient despite prolonged treatment of some patients. Non-synonymous/synonymous substitution rates among the tat sequences derived from patients with HIV-D were significantly higher compared to the HIV-ND group (P &lt; 0.001). The ratios of transversions to transitions were also significantly higher among the HIV-D tat sequences (P&lt; 0.01). Phylogenetic analyses showed clustering of sequences from each clinical group among the brain-derived tat and env sequences. These studies indicated that differing selective forces act on individual HIV-1 genes in the brain which may influence the development of dementia

	9765382,  third-generation lentivirus vector with a conditional packaging system.Vectors derived from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are highly efficient vehicles for in vivo gene delivery. However, their biosafety is of major concern. Here we exploit the complexity of the HIV genome to provide lentivirus vectors with novel biosafety features. In addition to the structural genes, HIV contains two regulatory genes, tat and rev, that are essential for HIV replication, and four accessory genes that encode critical virulence factors. We previously reported that the HIV type 1 accessory open reading frames are dispensable for efficient gene transduction by a lentivirus vector. We now demonstrate that the requirement for the tat gene can be offset by placing constitutive promoters upstream of the vector transcript. Vectors generated from constructs containing such a chimeric long terminal repeat (LTR) transduced neurons in vivo at very high efficiency, whether or not they were produced in the presence of Tat. When the rev gene was also deleted from the packaging construct, expression of gag and pol was strictly dependent on Rev complementation in trans. By the combined use of a separate nonoverlapping Rev expression plasmid and a 5' LTR chimeric transfer construct, we achieved optimal yields of vector of high transducing efficiency (up to 10(7) transducing units [TU]/ml and 10(4) TU/ng of p24). This third-generation lentivirus vector uses only a fractional set of HIV genes: gag, pol, and rev. Moreover, the HIV-derived constructs, and any recombinant between them, are contingent on upstream elements and trans complementation for expression and thus are nonfunctional outside of the vector producer cells. This split-genome, conditional packaging system is based on existing viral sequences and acts as a built-in device against the generation of productive recombinants. While the actual biosafety of the vector will ultimately be proven in vivo, the improved design presented here should facilitate testing of lentivirus vectors

	9765432, igh-titer human immunodeficiency virus type 1-based vector systems for gene delivery into nondividing cells.Previously we designed novel pseudotyped high-titer replication defective human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vectors to deliver genes into nondividing cells (J. Reiser, G. Harmison, S. Kluepfel-Stahl, R. O. Brady, S. Karlsson, and M. Schubert, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:15266-15271, 1996). Since then we have made several improvements with respect to the safety, flexibility, and efficiency of the vector system. A three-plasmid expression system is used to generate pseudotyped HIV-1 particles by transient transfection of human embryonic kidney 293T cells with a defective packaging construct, a plasmid coding for a heterologous envelope (Env) protein, and a vector construct harboring a reporter gene such as neo, ShlacZ (encoding a phleomycin resistance/beta-galactosidase fusion protein), HSA (encoding mouse heat-stable antigen), or EGFP (encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein). The packaging constructs lack functional Vif, Vpr, and Vpu proteins and/or a large portion of the Env coding region as well as the 5' and 3' long terminal repeats, the Nef function, and the presumed packaging signal. Using G418 selection, we routinely obtained vector particles pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G) with titers of up to 8 x 10(7) CFU/microgram of p24, provided that a functional Tat coding region was present in the vector. Vector constructs lacking a functional Tat protein yielded titers of around 4 x 10(6) to 8 x 10(6) CFU/microgram of p24. Packaging constructs with a mutation within the integrase (IN) core domain profoundly affected colony formation and expression of the reporter genes, indicating that a functional IN protein is required for efficient transduction. We explored the abilities of other Env proteins to allow formation of pseudotyped HIV-1 particles. The rabies virus and Mokola virus G proteins yielded high-titer infectious pseudotypes, while the human foamy virus Env protein did not. Using the improved vector system, we successfully transduced contact-inhibited primary human skin fibroblasts and postmitotic rat cerebellar neurons and cardiac myocytes, a process not affected by the lack of the accessory proteins

	9847371, haracterization of the Jembrana disease virus tat gene and the cis- and trans-regulatory elements in its long terminal repeats.Jembrana disease virus (JDV) is a newly identified bovine lentivirus that is closely related to the bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV). JDV contains a tat gene, encoded by two exons, which has potent transactivation activity. Cotransfection of the JDV tat expression plasmid with the JDV promoter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) construct pJDV-U3R resulted in a substantial increase in the level of CAT mRNA transcribed from the JDV long terminal repeat (LTR) and a dramatic increase in the CAT protein level. Deletion analysis of the LTR sequences showed that sequences spanning nucleotides -68 to +53, including the TATA box and the predicted first stem-loop structure of the predicted Tat response element (TAR), were required for efficient transactivation. The results, derived from site-directed mutagenesis experiments, suggested that the base pairing in the stem of the first stem-loop structure in the TAR region was important for JDV Tat-mediated transactivation; in contrast, nucleotide substitutions in the loop region of JDV TAR had less effect. For the JDV LTR, upstream sequences, from nucleotide -196 and beyond, as well as the predicted secondary structures in the R region, may have a negative effect on basal JDV promoter activity. Deletion of these regions resulted in a four- to fivefold increase in basal expression. The JDV Tat is also a potent transactivator of other animal and primate lentivirus promoters. It transactivated BIV and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) LTRs to levels similar to those with their homologous Tat proteins. In contrast, HIV-1 Tat has minimal effects on JDV LTR expression, whereas BIV Tat moderately transactivated the JDV LTR. Our study suggests that JDV may use a mechanism of transactivation similar but not identical to those of other animal and primate lentiviruses

	2400996, ifferential spectrum of expression of neural cell adhesion molecule isoforms and L1 adhesion molecules on human neuroectodermal tumors.A series of four medulloblastomas, seven neuroblastomas (Nb), two ependymomas, and three gliomas, human neuroectodermal tumors, were screened for their expression of adhesion molecules L1, carcinoembryonic antigen, neural cell adhesion molecule isoforms (N-CAM) and HNK1 epitope by Western blotting and double immunofluorescence labeling. All seven neuroblastomas, whatever their differentiated state, expressed L1, a neural cell surface developmental antigen, whereas all other tumors tested were negative. All tumors expressed N-CAM; however, a large diversity was observed among the isoforms. Low sialylated N-CAM 140 was present, with different intensity, in ependymomas and astrocytomas. High sialylated isoforms were detected by a monoclonal antibody (anti-MenB) specifically recognizing high polymers of alpha 2-8 linked neuraminic acid. They were expressed in all medulloblastomas studied (4 of 4), and in 4 of 7 Nbs examined. Negative cases corresponded to tumors having undergone chemotherapeutic treatment or to ganglioneuroma. The interconversion from high to low sialylated forms might reflect changes which are critical for the conversion of Nbs into benign ganglioneuromas. HNK1 epitope was expressed on a large diversity of molecules by nearly all tumors except two Nbs which were also negative with anti-MenB antibody. This simultaneous loss of carbohydrate epitopes could correlate with higher maturation states of the tumors. None of the tumors expressed carcinoembryonic antigen. Therefore, anti-L1 and anti-MenB antibodies define differentiation-related antigens that could differentiate between Nbs and other tumors and may prove helpful in diagnosis and understanding of the biological nature of neuroectodermal tumors. An immunodot assay was set up and allowed to titrate the presence of polysialic acid units in cerebrospinal fluid from patients presenting meningeal spread of medulloblastomas. It could help to assess metastasis and to monitor the effects of chemotherapeutic treatment on polysialylated N-CAM positive tumors

	19216096, orrelation of electroretinography b-wave absolute latency, plasma levels of human basic fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, soluble fatty acid synthase, and adrenomedullin in diabetic retinopathy.BACKGROUND: We investigated the b-wave latency of electroretinogram (ERG), human basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), soluble fatty acid synthase (s-Fas), and adrenomedullin (ADM) in diabetic retinopathy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty control and 60 type II diabetic women (mean age 45+/-3.9 years, duration of diabetes 10.1+/-2.1 years) were investigated. Diabetics without complications (Group II) and with retinopathy (Group III) were diagnosed depending on clinical findings, abnormal fundus examination, and ERG. Plasma levels of b-FGF, VEGF, s-Fas, and ADM were measured. RESULTS: ERG showed a significant increase of b-wave absolute latency, plasma b-FGF, VEGF, s-Fas, and ADM in diabetic retinopathy (P&lt;.05). A positive correlation was found between b-wave latency and VEGF and s-Fas, and a negative correlation with b-FGF and ADM. CONCLUSION: This study elucidates the causative role of VEGF and s-Fas in diabetic retinopathy. VEGF may potently promote growth of endothelial cells and formation of new vessels implicated in proliferative retinopathy. s-Fas could be involved in advancement of apoptotic changes in retinopathy and high levels of b-FGF, and ADM may be compensatorily neuroprotective and vasculoprotective. The results showed that diabetic retinopathy is the result of multiple factors, so it is optimistic to believe that reversing VEGF or s-Fas will halt retinopathy, targeting multiple mechanisms simultaneously by administering combination treatments of VEGF antagonists; antiapoptotic drugs together with b-FGF and/or ADM may be prospective

	19706691, ranscription profiling and regulation of fat metabolism genes in diapausing adults of the mosquito Culex pipiens.Culex pipiens, the mosquito that vectors West Nile virus in North America, overwinters in an adult diapause (dormancy) that is programmed by the short day length and low temperatures of autumn. In response to these environmental signals, females cease feeding on blood and instead seek sources of nectar used to generate the huge lipid reserves required for winter survival. To identify regulatory networks that regulate fat accumulation and fat consumption during diapause, we compared expression of fat-related genes from nondiapausing females with expression of those same genes in early and late diapause and at diapause termination. Among the 31 genes we examined, 4 were expressed more highly in early diapause than in nondiapause, while 14 genes were downregulated in early diapause. In the transition from early to late diapause, 19 genes related to fat metabolism were upregulated. As reported previously, fatty acid synthase, identified as fas-1 in this study, was upregulated in early diapause. Numerous fat metabolism genes, including multiple kinetic classes and genes involved in beta-oxidation, an energy-generation step, were suppressed in early diapause but were highly expressed in late diapause and at diapause termination. RNA interference (RNAi) analysis revealed that the fas-1 gene and others (fas-3 and fabp) have important roles in fat storage during early diapause. When expression of these genes is suppressed, female mosquitoes fail to sequester the lipids needed for overwintering

	19755139, is-acting elements responsible for dopaminergic neuron-specific expression of zebrafish slc6a3 (dopamine transporter) in vivo are located remote from the transcriptional start site.The purpose of this study was to analyze the transcriptional regulation of the zebrafish solute carrier family 6 member 3 gene (slc6a3, dopamine transporter, dat), as a first step towards isolating regulatory sequences useful for driving transgene expression within dopaminergic neurons of the zebrafish CNS in vivo. We found that the 3.0 kb slc6a3 mRNA is expressed in each of the major groups of dopaminergic neurons previously identified in the zebrafish CNS. The slc6a3 gene spans &gt;20 kb of genomic DNA and contains 15 exons. The genomic organization of slc6a3 is highly conserved with respect to its human orthologue, including the presence of an untranslated first exon. The promoter lacks a canonical TATA box and there are multiple transcriptional start sites. Functional analysis of cis-acting elements responsible for the expression pattern of slc6a3 was carried out by generating stable transgenic zebrafish lines expressing fluorescent reporters under transcriptional control of fragments of slc6a3 genomic sequence. The region between -2 kb and +5 kb with respect to the transcriptional start site contains the core slc6a3 promoter, in addition to neuronal enhancers and/or non-neuronal repressors that restrict expression to the CNS, but this region lacks cis-acting elements responsible for slc6a3 expression in dopaminergic neurons. The upstream sequence between -6 kb and -2 kb contains an enhancer element that drives slc6a3 expression in dopaminergic neurons of the pretectal region, and additional sequences that partially repress expression in non-dopaminergic neurons. However, expression of slc6a3 in dopaminergic neurons of the ventral diencephalon and telencephalon is dependent on elements that lie outside the region -6 kb to +5 kb. These data provide a detailed analysis of the slc6a3 gene and show that its expression in different populations of dopamine neurons is driven by discrete enhancers, rather than a single target sequence for a terminal factor involved in specifying neurochemical phenotype

	19440379, denovirus dodecahedron, as a drug delivery vector.BACKGROUND: Bleomycin (BLM) is an anticancer antibiotic used in many cancer regimens. Its utility is limited by systemic toxicity and dose-dependent pneumonitis able to progress to lung fibrosis. The latter can affect up to nearly 50% of the total patient population, out of which 3% will die. We propose to improve BLM delivery by tethering it to an efficient delivery vector. Adenovirus (Ad) dodecahedron base (DB) is a particulate vector composed of 12 copies of a pentameric viral protein responsible for virus penetration. The vector efficiently penetrates the plasma membrane, is liberated in the cytoplasm and has a propensity to concentrate around the nucleus; up to 300000 particles can be observed in one cell in vitro. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Dodecahedron (Dd) structure is preserved at up to about 50 degrees C at pH 7-8 and during dialysis, freezing and drying in the speed-vac in the presence of 150 mM ammonium sulfate, as well as during lyophilization in the presence of cryoprotectants. The vector is also stable in human serum for 2 h at 37 degrees C. We prepared a Dd-BLM conjugate which upon penetration induced death of transformed cells. Similarly to free bleomycin, Dd-BLM caused dsDNA breaks. Significantly, effective cytotoxic concentration of BLM delivered with Dd was 100 times lower than that of free bleomycin. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Stability studies show that Dds can be conveniently stored and transported, and can potentially be used for therapeutic purposes under various climates. Successful BLM delivery by Ad Dds demonstrates that the use of virus like particle (VLP) results in significantly improved drug bioavailability. These experiments open new vistas for delivery of non-permeant labile drugs

	19430900, ole of normalization in the elimination of abundant myelin sequences in spinal cord cDNA libraries produced by suppression subtractive hybridization.Spinal cord libraries subtracted against visual cortex using suppression subtractive hybridization SSH are dominated by abundant gene sequences derived from myelin elements. We compared our subtracted library results of three of these abundant sequences to published expressed sequence tag libraries that are not normalized and not subtracted and presumed representatives of murine spinal cord mRNA abundance. We show that: all three abundant sequences, myelin basic protein (Mbp), proteolipid protein (Plp1) and Ferretin heavy chain (Fth1) are highly expressed in spinal cord when this structure is compared to visual cortex; myelin basic protein is represented in our subtracted libraries but at a low frequency, whereas Plp1 and Fth1 represent nearly one-third of all sequences in these libraries; mirror orientation selection, a procedure designed to reduce background sequences, generates libraries very similar in abundance to SSH; proteolipid protein can be reduced in these libraries by adding Plp1 sequences to the driver in the SSH procedure and also by subtracting Plp1 directly from tester and driver. We conclude that adequate normalization is essential to reduce the presence of abundant sequences in SSH libraries

	19487109, bnormal expression of myelination genes and alterations in white matter fractional anisotropy following prenatal viral influenza infection at E16 in mice.Prenatal viral infection has been associated with the development of schizophrenia and autism. Our laboratory has previously shown that viral infection causes deleterious effects on brain structure and function in mouse offspring following late first trimester (E9) and late second trimester (E18) administration of influenza virus. We hypothesized that middle second trimester infection (E16) in mice may lead to a different pattern of brain gene expression and structural defects in the developing offspring. C57BL6 mice were infected on E16 with a sublethal dose of human influenza virus or sham-infected using vehicle solution. Male offspring of the infected mice were collected at P0, P14, P35, and P56, their brains removed and cerebella dissected and flash frozen. Microarray, DTI and MRI scanning, as well as qRT-PCR and SDS-PAGE and western blotting analyses were performed to detect differences in gene expression and brain atrophy. Expression of several genes associated with myelination, including Mbp, Mag, and Plp1 were found to be altered, as were protein levels of Mbp, Mag, and DM20. Brain imaging revealed significant atrophy in cerebellum at P14, reduced fractional anisotropy in white matter of the right internal capsule at P0, and increased fractional anisotropy in white matter in corpus callosum at P14 and right middle cerebellar peduncle at P56. We propose that maternal infection in mouse impacts myelination genes

	19808102, utation in the myelin proteolipid protein gene alters BK and SK channel function in the caudal medulla.Proteolipid protein (Plp) gene mutation in rodents causes severe CNS dysmyelination, early death, and lethal hypoxic ventilatory depression (Miller et al., 2004). To determine if Plp mutation alters neuronal function critical for control of breathing, the nucleus tractus solitarii (nTS) of four rodent strains were studied: myelin deficient rats (MD), myelin synthesis deficient (Plp(msd)), and Plp(null) mice, as well as shiverer (Mbp(shi)) mice, a myelin basic protein mutant. Current-voltage relationships were analyzed using whole-cell patch-clamp in 300 microm brainstem slices. Voltage steps were applied, and inward and outward currents quantified. MD, Plp(msd), and Plp(null), but not Mbp(shi) neurons exhibited reduced outward current in nTS at P21. Apamin blockade of SK calcium-dependent currents and iberiotoxin blockade of BK calcium-dependent currents in the P21 MD rat demonstrated reduced outward current due to dysfunction of these channels. These results provide evidence that Plp mutation specifically alters neuronal excitability through calcium-dependent potassium channels in nTS

	19918882, isualization of myelination in GFP-transgenic zebrafish.The insulation of axons in the vertebrate nervous system by myelin is essential for efficient axonal conduction. Myelination disruption and remyelination failure can cause human diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and hereditary myelin diseases. However, despite progress in understanding myelination regulation, many important questions remain unanswered. To investigate the mechanisms underlying myelination in vivo, we generated transgenic zebrafish expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the mbp promoter. This transgenic fish displayed faithful EGFP expression in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells in embryonic and adult zebrafish. Interestingly, although myelination progressed continuously in the postembryonic central nervous system, some of the spinal cord regions were filled with unmyelinated axons even in the adult spinal cord, suggesting functional differences between myelinated and unmyelinated axons. Our results suggest that this transgenic zebrafish could be a valuable animal model to study oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination in vivo

	20140960, emporal dynamics of myelination in the zebrafish spinal cord.Knowledge of the precise timing of myelination is critical to the success of zebrafish-based in vivo screening strategies for potential remyelination therapies. This study provides a systematic review of the timing of myelination in the zebrafish spinal cord and a critique of techniques by which it may be accurately assessed. The onset of myelination was found to be 3 days postfertilization (d.p.f.); earlier than previously reported. This coincided with the dorsal migration and differentiation of oligodendrocytes and the expression of myelin basic protein (Mbp) transcripts and protein. Our data suggests that immunohistochemistry with zebrafish-specific anti-Mbp from 3 d.p.f. is the optimal histological method for myelin visualization, while quantification of myelination is more reliably achieved by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for mbp from 5 d.p.f.. Transgenic fluorescent lines such as olig2:EGFP can be used to assess oligodendrocyte cell number at 3 d.p.f. and the development of new, more specific lines may enable real time visualization of myelin itself. Quantitative ultrastructural analysis revealed that the myelination of zebrafish axons is regulated according to axonal growth and not absolute axonal size. This study confirms the use of the zebrafish larvae as a versatile and efficient in vivo model of myelination and provides a platform on which future myelination screening studies can be based

	20353813, tructure and expression of myelin basic protein gene products in Xenopus laevis.To study roles of the myelin basic protein (mbp) gene products in nervous system development, cDNA cloning and expression analyses were performed in Xenopus laevis. We cloned cDNAs for XMBP.1 and XMBP.2 encoded by xmbp.1 and xmbp.2 genes, respectively. We also identified xmbp.1 gene transcripts encoding three XGolli (X.laevis gene of the oligodendrocyte lineage) proteins, XBG21.1, XJ37.1, and XTP8.1, which are homologues of mouse BG21, J37, and TP8, respectively. In reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses, the XMBP, XJ37, and XTP8 mRNAs were expressed in brain, ovaries, testes, and/or thymus in frogs and in larvae after hatching. In contrast, the XBG21 mRNA was found fairly ubiquitously in adult tissues, unfertilized eggs and embryos throughout the developmental stages examined. Western blot analyses using three different monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) showed that the central and peripheral myelin contained 20kDa and18.5 kDa XMBP variants. In addition, XMBP was found in thymus by Western blotting and in thymocyte cytoplasm immunocytochemically. However, the XGolli protein, most provably XBG21, was detectable only in testes. The results indicate that the structure of xmbp gene products seems highly conserved among amphibians and mammals, although their expression patterns and thus physiological roles may partially differ. This is the first report that systematically describes the mbp gene products in nonmammalian vertebrates

	19172243,  copper(II)-selective chelator ameliorates left-ventricular hypertrophy in type 2 diabetic patients: a randomised placebo-controlled study.AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Cu(II)-selective chelation with trientine ameliorates cardiovascular and renal disease in a model of diabetes in rats. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Cu(II)-selective chelation might improve left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: We performed a 12 month randomised placebo-controlled study of the effects of treatment with the Cu(II)-selective chelator trientine (triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride, 600 mg given orally twice daily) on LVH in diabetic patients (n = 15/group at baseline) in an outpatient setting wherein participants, caregivers and those assessing outcomes were blinded to group assignment. Using MRI, we measured left ventricular variables at baseline, and at months 6 and 12. The change from baseline in left ventricular mass indexed to body surface area (LVM(bsa)) was the primary endpoint variable. RESULTS: Diabetic patients had LVH with preserved ejection fraction at baseline. Trientine treatment decreased LVM(bsa) by 5.0 +/- 7.2 g/m(2) (mean +/- SD) at month 6 (when 14 trientine-treated and 14 placebo-treated participants were analysed; p = 0.0056 compared with placebo) and by 10.6 +/- 7.6 g/m(2) at month 12 (when nine trientine-treated and 13 placebo-treated participants were analysed; p = 0.0088), whereas LVM(bsa) was unchanged by placebo treatment. In a multiple-regression model that explained ~75% of variation (R (2) = 0.748, p = 0.001), cumulative urinary Cu excretion over 12 months was positively associated with trientine-evoked decreases in LVM(bsa). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Cu(II)-selective chelation merits further exploration as a potential pharmacotherapy for diabetic heart disease.

Five cases of this cluster were studied and a diagnosis of malignant schwannoma was established. Electron microscopy (em) of tumour samples from three of the animals revealed intracytoplasmic or interstitial structures resembling retroviral particles. Attempts to isolate a viral agent from the tumours were unsuccessful but the epidemiological data and the em findings suggest a viral aetiology

	19011203, eight and nutrition affect pre-mRNA splicing of a muscle gene associated with performance, energetics and life history.A fundamental feature of gene expression in multicellular organisms is the production of distinct transcripts from single genes by alternative splicing (AS), which amplifies protein and functional diversity. In spite of the likely consequences for organismal biology, little is known about how AS varies among individuals or responds to body condition, environmental variation or extracellular signals in general. Here we show that evolutionarily conserved AS of troponin-t in flight muscle of adult moths responds in a quantitative fashion to experimental manipulation of larval nutrition and adult body weight. Troponin-t (Tnt) isoform composition is known to affect muscle force and power output in other animals, and is shown here to be associated with the thorax mass-specific rate of energy consumption during flight. Loading of adults with external weights for 5 days caused an AS response nearly identical to equal increases in actual body weight. In addition, there were effects of larval feeding history on adult Tnt isoform composition that were independent of body weight, with moths from poorer larval feeding regimes producing isoform profiles associated with reduced muscle performance and energy consumption rate. Thus, Tnt isoform composition in striated muscle is responsive to both weight-sensing and nutrition-sensing mechanisms, with consequent effects on function. In free-living butterflies, Tnt isoform composition was also associated with activity level and very strongly with the rate of egg production. Overall, these results show that AS of a muscle gene responds in a quantitative fashion to whole-organism variables, which apparently serves to coordinate muscle strength and energy expenditure with body condition and life history

	19816656, tilization and outcome of thrombolytic therapy for acute stroke in Pakistan.Our objective was to identify the outcome of patients treated with tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPa) in Pakistan and compare these data to available regional and international data. The charts of all patients treated with r-tPa for acute stroke at two centers in Pakistan (Aga Khan University, Karachi and Liaquat National hospital, Karachi) were retrospectively reviewed. We identified 21 patients. The utilization of tPa at Aga Khan Hospital was 18/1,185 patients (1.5%) from 2005 to 2007 while at Liaquat National Hospital was 3/575 patients (0.52%) over 1 year (2007). Mean time interval between stroke onset and start of r-tPa infusion was 169 min. Three patients (14%) developed fatal hemorrhage and two (10%) developed non-fatal hemorrhage. Four patients (19%) died. We identified protocol violations in seven patients (33%). In conclusion, the utilization of thrombolytic therapy is low and complication rate is high. Interventions for training physicians are needed

	18422784, unctional analysis of single amino-acid mutations in the thrombopoietin-receptor Mpl underlying congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia.Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT) is a rare disorder that presents with severe thrombocytopenia and absence of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. The disease may develop into bone marrow aplasia. Genetic defects in the gene encoding the thrombopoietin (Tpo) receptor, MPL, are the cause of this disease. In a previous study, we identified four missense mutations in CAMT patients, predicting Arg102Pro, Pro136His, Arg257Cys and Pro635Leu. To investigate whether these mutations result in defective Tpo-binding and/or signalling, full-length wildtype and mutant MPL were transduced into K562 cells. Expression levels and the ability to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase, Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription and phosphoinositide-3 kinase pathways upon Tpo-binding were studied. The results predicted that MPL carrying the P136H or P635L mutation was not properly expressed, whereas the R102P and R257C mutations resulted in impaired signal transduction. Our results indicate that a severe clinical course may be expected when these mutations lead to absent Mpl expression or signalling in CAMT patients with missense mutations

	18487512, RRL motifs in the cytoplasmic domain of the thrombopoietin receptor regulate receptor internalization and degradation.Thrombopoietin (Tpo), acting through the c-Mpl receptor, promotes the survival and proliferation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and drives megakaryocyte differentiation. The proproliferation and survival signals activated by Tpo must therefore be tightly regulated to prevent uncontrolled cell growth. In this work, we determined the mechanisms that control Tpo-stimulated c-Mpl internalization and defined the processes leading to its degradation. Stimulation of BaF-Mpl cells with Tpo leads to rapid, clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the receptor. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA), we found that inhibition of adaptor protein 2 (AP2), which mediates endocytosis of transmembrane proteins, strongly attenuates Tpo-stimulated c-Mpl internalization. AP2 interacts with YXXPhi motifs and we identified 2 such motifs in c-Mpl (Y(8)RRL and Y(78)RRL) and investigated Tpo-stimulated internalization of receptors bearing point mutations at these sites. After Tpo stimulation, internalization was greatly reduced in c-Mpl Y(78)F and c-Mpl Y(8+78)F, and these cell lines also exhibited increased proliferation and increased strength and duration of Jak2, STAT5, AKT, and ERK1/2 activation in response to Tpo. We also found that the Y(8)RRL motif regulates Tpo-stimulated lysosomal degradation of c-Mpl. Our data establishes that c-Mpl cytoplasmic YRRL motifs are responsible for both Tpo-mediated internalization via interactions with AP2 and lysosomal targeting after endocytosis

	18552713, ffects of sepsis on neonatal thrombopoiesis.We serially evaluated the effects of sepsis and/or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) on neonatal thrombopoiesis, using a panel of tests that included platelet counts, thrombopoietin concentrations (Tpo), circulating megakaryocyte progenitor concentrations (CMPs), and reticulated platelets (RPs). Variables analyzed included sepsis type, time after onset of sepsis, platelet counts, and gestational (GA) and postconceptional ages (PCA). Twenty neonates were enrolled. Ten had Gram-negative, six had Gram-positive, and four had presumed sepsis. Four neonates had NEC stage II or higher, and six developed thrombocytopenia. Overall, septic neonates had significantly elevated Tpo concentrations and circulating megakaryocyte progenitors. The highest Tpo levels were associated with Gram-negative or presumed sepsis. RP percentages were increased only in neonates with low platelet counts, while RP counts (RP% x platelet count) were elevated in neonates with high platelet counts. Our findings suggest that septic neonates up-regulate Tpo production, leading to increased megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet release, although the degree of upregulation is moderate. The changes in RP% and RP count most likely reflect increased thrombopoiesis with variable degrees of platelet consumption. In addition, our findings suggest that different factors, likely including level of illness and/or specific platelet or bacterial products, can down-regulate the magnitude of the thrombopoietic response

	18778936, iscovery and biological evaluation of benzo[a]carbazole-based small molecule agonists of the thrombopoietin (Tpo) receptor.A novel series of benzo[a]carbazole-based small molecule agonists of the thrombopoietin (Tpo) receptor is reported.

	18783949, ptimization of small molecule agonists of the thrombopoietin (Tpo) receptor derived from a benzo[a]carbazole hit scaffold.The lead optimization of a novel series of benzo[a]carbazole-based small molecule agonists of the thrombopoietin (Tpo) receptor is reported. The chemical instability of the dihydro-benzo[a]carbazole lead 2 was successfully addressed in the design and evaluation of compounds which also demonstrated improved potency compared to 2. Members of the scaffold have been identified which are full agonists that demonstrate cellular functional potency &lt;50 nM.

	18845793, ronounced thrombocytosis in transgenic mice expressing reduced levels of Mpl in platelets and terminally differentiated megakaryocytes.We generated mice expressing a full-length Mpl transgene under the control of a 2-kb Mpl promoter in an Mpl(-/-) background, effectively obtaining mice that express full-length Mpl in the absence of other Mpl isoforms. These mice developed thrombocytosis with platelet levels approximately 5-fold higher than wild-type controls and markedly increased megakaryocyte numbers. The reintroduction of one wild-type Mpl allele restored normal platelet counts. We excluded the deletion of Mpl-tr, a dominant-negative isoform, as the underlying molecular cause for thrombocytosis. Instead, we found that transgene expression driven by the 2-kb Mpl promoter fragment was decreased during late megakaryocyte maturation, resulting in strongly diminished Mpl protein expression in platelets. Because platelets exert a negative feedback on thrombopoiesis by binding and consuming Tpo in the circulation through Mpl, we propose that the severe reduction of Mpl protein in platelets in Mpl-transgenic Mpl(-/-) mice shifts the equilibrium of this feedback loop, resulting in markedly elevated levels of megakaryocytes and platelets at steady state. Although the mechanism causing decreased expression of Mpl protein in platelets from patients with myeloproliferative disorders differs from this transgenic model, our results suggest that lowering Mpl protein in platelets could contribute to raising the platelet count

	18925510, hrombopoietin following transfusion of platelets in preterm neonates.Thrombocytopenia is common in the neonatal intensive care unit. Transfusion of platelets is often required. The purpose of our study was to determine changes in thrombopoietin (Tpo) following transfusion of platelets in preterm neonates. Preterm neonates undergoing platelet transfusion were randomized to receive a transfusion volume of either 10 or 15 ml/kg. Blood was obtained for Tpo measurement pre-transfusion, one and 24 hours post-transfusion. Platelet Factor 4 (PF4) was also measured to quantify platelet activation. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated measures ANOVA, and Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate. Ten infants were enrolled in each group. Gestational age, birth weight, etiology of thrombocytopenia, and timing of transfusion did not differ between the 10 and 15 ml/kg groups. There were no differences between the groups in platelet count prior to and/or following transfusion. Both transfusion volumes were equally well tolerated. Tpo and PF4 did not differ between groups at any of the study time points. When both groups were analysed together, Tpo dropped 43% (95% confidence 37-49%, p = 0.01) 1-hour post compared to pre-transfusion. In conclusion the observed decrease in Tpo following platelet transfusion suggests that Tpo kinetics in neonates is similar to adults following transfusion. PF4 was not affected by transfusion. There was not an increase in platelet count following transfusion volume of 15 ml/kg compared to 10 ml/kg

	18977403, ytokine-immobilized microparticle-coated plates for culturing hematopoietic progenitor cells.The purpose of this study was to provide a culture method for an effective expansion of human CD 34 positive hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD 34 (+) HCs) utilizing low molecular weight heparin/protamine microparticles (LH/P MPs) which can be stably coated onto plastic surfaces and cytokines. CD 34 (+) HCs optimally proliferated on LH/P MP-coated plates in the presence of stem cell factor (SCF; 5 ng/ml), thrombopoietin (Tpo; 10 ng/ml), and Flt-3 ligand (Flt-3; 10 ng/ml) in hematopoietic progenitor growth medium (HPGM). After 6 days, the total cells expanded 16.5-fold. Those cytokines were shown to be partially immobilized on the LH/P MP-coated plates, and the immobilized cytokines were gradually released into the medium with half releasing time of 3-4 days. Since flow cytometry analyses revealed that 90% of initial cells and 44.5% of expanded cells were CD 34 positive, CD 34 (+) HCs were estimated to have increased 8.0-fold after 6 days, and to have increased to over 31.9-fold after 12 days. In contrast, cultured CD 34 (+) HCs on non-coated tissue culture plates increased only 2.9-fold in the identical medium after 6 days, and only 5.2-fold after 12 days

	19689996, hrombocytopenia in patients with chronic hepatitis C: a possible role of HCV on platelet progenitor cell maturation.A total of 30 patients with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) thrombocytopenia (TP) and 20 healthy controls were studied. Both groups were subjected to complete medical history, clinical examination in addition to assessment of hepatitis markers: level of thrombopoietin (Tpo), Geimsa-stained bone marrow smears, and in vitro short-term megakaryocytic progenitors culture (CFU-MK). Serum Tpo level was significantly elevated in patients with TP HCV. Short-term CFU-MK showed an evident depression in the colony-forming unit-megakaryocyte (CFU-meg). There is a positive correlation between the number of CFU-meg and the platelet count and between serum Tpo level and prothrombin time, transaminase, albumin, and the Child Pugh score of liver disease; a negative correlation between serum Tpo level and the number of CFU-meg and between serum Tpo level and the platelet count. Thus, the level of Tpo could be an indicator of intact functional response of the hepatocytes

	19880496, biquitination and degradation of the thrombopoietin receptor c-Mpl.Regulation of growth factor and cytokine signaling is essential for maintaining physiologic numbers of circulating hematopoietic cells. Thrombopoietin (Tpo), acting through its receptor c-Mpl, is required for hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and megakaryopoiesis. Therefore, the negative regulation of Tpo signaling is critical in many aspects of hematopoiesis. In this study, we determine the mechanisms of c-Mpl degradation in the negative regulation of Tpo signaling. We found that, after Tpo stimulation, c-Mpl is degraded by both the lysosomal and proteasomal pathways and c-Mpl is rapidly ubiquitinated. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we were able to determine that c-Mpl is ubiquitinated on both of its intracellular lysine (K) residues (K(553) and K(573)). By mutating these residues to arginine, ubiquitination and degradation were significantly reduced and caused hyperproliferation in cell lines expressing these mutated receptors. Using short interfering RNA and dominant negative overexpression, we also found that c-Cbl, which is activated by Tpo, acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in the ubiquitination of c-Mpl. Our findings identify a previously unknown negative regulatory pathway for Tpo signaling that may significantly impact our understanding of the mechanisms affecting the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells and megakaryocytes

	20008193, eterminants of platelet number and regulation of thrombopoiesis.Our understanding of thrombopoiesis has improved greatly in the last two decades with the availability of in vitro assays of megakaryocyte progenitor cell growth, with the cloning and characterization of stem cell factor (SCF) and thrombopoietin (Tpo), the latter the primary humoral regulator of this process, and with the generation of genetically altered murine models of thrombopoietic failure and excess. While SCF affects developmentally early aspects of megakaryocyte growth, Tpo affects nearly all aspects of platelet production, from hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal and expansion, through stimulation of megakaryocyte progenitor cell proliferation, to supporting their maturation into platelet-producing cells. The molecular and cellular mechanisms through which the marrow microenvironment and humoral mediators affect platelet production provide new insights into the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic influences on hematopoiesis, and highlight new opportunities to translate basic biology into clinical advances

	10357249, euroadaptations in the dopaminergic system after active self-administration but not after passive administration of methamphetamine.Methamphetamine is a strong and long-lasting stimulant that can be easily synthesized and is effective when taken either orally, intravenously, or smoked as 'ice'. Due to it's escalating abuse, a clear need exists for laboratory procedures to evaluate motivational components of methamphetamine abuse and their underlying neurobiological mechanisms. In the present experiment, we utilized a 'yoked' procedure in which rats were run simultaneously in groups of three, with two rats serving as yoked controls which received an injection of either 0.1 mg/kg methamphetamine or saline which was not contingent on responding each time a response-contingent injection of 0.1 mg/kg methamphetamine was self-administered by the third paired rat. Rats that had actively self-administered methamphetamine for 5 weeks and were then withdrawn from methamphetamine for 24 h showed marked decreases in somatodendritic dopamine D2 autoreceptors levels in the ventral tegmental area (34%) and medial (31%) and dorsal (21%) part of the substantia nigra zona compacta with a corresponding down-regulation of dopamine D1 receptors in the shell of the nucleus accumbens (15%), as measured by in vitro quantitative autoradiography. Since the decreases in levels of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors which occurred in rats self-administering methamphetamine did not occur in littermates that received either yoked injections of methamphetamine or saline, these changes likely reflect motivational states that were present when methamphetamine injection depended on active drug self-administration behavior

	10573301, ethamphetamines: use and trafficking in the Tucson-Nogales area.A national increase in the use of methamphetamine, a cheap, accessible, and dangerous drug, prompted the National Institute on Drug Addiction to sponsor an ethnographic study in the Tucson-Nogales area. This area has experienced a rapid rise in methamphetamine (also known as meth, speed, crank, smoke, or crystal ice) use during the past 3 years. Mexican and Canadian borders are ports of entry for meth and precursor substances, and home manufacturing has increased substantially. The dual consequences of overdose and addiction result in devastating long-term psychological and physiological problems. Increased law enforcement and citizen awareness in controlling the  epidemic  are key elements in curbing the problem

	10706978, he suspected association between methamphetamine ('ice') smoking and frequent episodes of alcohol intoxication: data from the 1993 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse.This study estimates the strength of association between frequent episodes of alcohol intoxication and recent smoking of methamphetamine ('ice'). Drawn from the 1993 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, a total of 101 ice smokers were matched on neighborhood of residence to 816 non-smokers. Based upon conditional logistic regression analyses, persons with daily episodes of alcohol intoxication were an estimated five times more likely to have smoked ice, as compared with non-drinkers or drinkers with little or no history of alcohol intoxication. This estimate includes statistical adjustment for potential confounders (e.g. age, sex) and was statistically significant (P=0.01). The association between frequent alcohol intoxication and 'ice smoking' offers an intriguing lead for a broad range of new research

	11085306, wo inbred strains of rats, Fischer 344 and Lewis, showed differential behavior and brain expression of corticosterone receptor mRNA induced by methamphetamine.Recently, a role of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis in facilitating the behavioral and neurochemical effects of psychostimulants has been proposed. Two inbred strains of rats, Fischer 344/N (F344) and Lewis/N (LEW), have markedly different HPA axes as well as behavioral responses to psychostimulants: F344 rats show hyperresponsive HPA axis and no significant sensitization to cocaine, whereas LEW rats display blunted response in HPA axis and develop cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. Corticosterone exerts its biological effects via intracellular receptors, termed type I (mineralocorticoid receptor: MR) and type II (glucocorticoid receptor: GR). The present study examines the development of stereotypy sensitization and the brain expression of mRNAs for MR, GR, and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) in methamphetamine (MAP)-treated F344 and LEW rats. Animals received i.p. injections with chronic saline (SAL: once daily for 21 days), chronic saline and acute MAP (AM: saline for 20 days and 4 mg/kg MAP on the 21st day), or chronic MAP (CM: 4 mg/kg MAP for 21 days) and were sacrificed three hours after the last injections. Striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum were quickly dissected on ice and total RNA was isolated for northern analyses. LEW rats developed stereotypy sensitization significantly earlier than F344 rats. AM significantly decreased GR and MR mRNA expression in hippocampus of LEW, compared to SAL. CM significantly increased GR and MR mRNA expression in striatum of F344 compared to SAL and AM, while it decreased GR mRNA in striatum of LEW and MR mRNA in hippocampus, compared to SAL. AM significantly increased HSP90 mRNA in all brain regions examined, without the hippocampus in LEW. CM significantly increased the expression of HSP90 mRNA in the striatum and cerebellum of F344, but significantly decreased in the striatum and hippocampus of LEW. These contrasting differences between F344 and LEW, in their susceptibility to stereotypy sensitization and striatal expression of GR mRNA by chronic MAP, suggest that some striatal genes, whose transcription is regulated by GR, play a crucial role in the development of MAP-induced behavioral sensitization

	11224724, irway effects of marijuana, cocaine, and other inhaled illicit agents.Several substances besides tobacco are inhaled for recreational purposes, including marijuana, crack cocaine, amyl and butyl nitrites, heroin, methamphetamine, and phencyclidine. Abuse of most of these inhaled substances has risen in recent years, thereby increasing concern about potential pulmonary and other medical complications. Regular marijuana use can lead to extensive airway injury and alterations in the structure and function of alveolar macrophages, potentially predisposing to pulmonary infection and respiratory cancer. Crack cocaine use can lead to a variety of acute pulmonary complications, including severe exacerbations of asthma and an acute lung injury syndrome associated with a broad spectrum of histopathologic changes ( crack lung ). Habitual cocaine smoking may also produce more subtle long-term pulmonary consequences due to chronic alveolar epithelial and microvascular lung injury. Heroin inhalation can induce severe and even fatal exacerbations of asthma. Pulmonary consequences of inhaled amyl and butyl nitrites, crystalline methamphetamine (ice), and phencyclidine have been less well documented

	11831497, atterns of methamphetamine abuse and their consequences.The abuse of methamphetamine (METH) continues to increase throughout all age groups in different regions of the United States.  Ice,  the popularized jargon for (+) methamphetamine hydrochloride, is the predominant drug form that is now consumed.  Ice  is effectively absorbed after either smoking or snorting and it is this rapid influx of drug that produces effects similar to those after intravenous administration. The intensity of METH actions in the central and peripheral nervous system shows tolerance after chronic administration, indicating that neuroadaptations have occurred. Thus, the physiological processes and corresponding biochemical mechanisms that regulate neuronal function have been changed by METH exposure. These biological alterations contribute to the craving and dependence associated with METH abuse and the withdrawal syndrome upon abstinence. However, these changes in behavior may also result from METH-induced neurotoxicity. This article reviews aspects of METH pharmacokinetics and related molecular pharmacodynamics that represent METH pharmacology and then relates those actions to their potential to produce neurotoxicity in humans

	12537703, he emergence of potent forms of methamphetamine in Sydney, Australia: a case study of the IDRS as a strategic early warning system.A striking finding of the Illicit Drug Reporting System (IDRS) in recent years has concerned the emergence in Sydney of a number of different forms of potent methamphetamine. This paper demonstrates the operation of the IDRS in detecting and documenting an increase in both the availability and use of these forms of methamphetamine in Sydney, and Australia more widely, since 1998. Data from different components of the IDRS are utilized to propose that there are currently at least three forms of methamphetamine available in Sydney that are considered by the market to be distinct commodities: methamphetamine powder ('speed'), base methamphetamine ('base') and crystalline methamphetamine ('ice'/'shabu'/'crystal meth'). Base and ice are more potent forms of methamphetamine than speed, and international experience, along with preliminary data obtained from the IDRS, suggest that their use is associated with harms in a number of domains

	14515361, ycloheximide and actinomycin D delay death and affect bcl-2, bax, and Ice gene expression in astrocytes under in vitro ischemia.An in vitro ischemia model was established and the effect of the metabolic inhibitors cycloheximide (CHX) and actinomycin D (ActD) on apoptosis in astrocytes under ischemia studied. CHX decreased by 75% the number of cells dying after 6 hr of ischemia compared with control cultures. TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) staining of comparable cultures was reduced by 40%. ActD decreased cell death by 60% compared with controls. The number of TUNEL-positive cells was reduced by 38%. The nuclear shrinkage in TUNEL-positive astrocytes in control cultures did not occur in ActD-treated astrocytes, indicating that nuclear shrinkage and DNA fragmentation during apoptosis are two unrelated processes. Expression of bcl-2 (alpha and beta), bax, and Ice in astrocytes under similar ischemic conditions, as measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, indicated that ischemia down-regulated bcl-2 (alpha and beta) and bax. Ice was initially down-regulated from 0 to 4 hr, before returning to control levels after 8 hr of ischemia. ActD decreased the expression of these genes. CHX reduced the expression of bcl-2 (alpha and beta) but increased bax and Ice expression. It is hypothesized that the balance of proapoptotic (Bad, Bax) and antiapoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-Xl) proteins determines apoptosis. The data suggest that the ratio of Bcl-2/Bad in astrocytes following ActD and CHX treatment does not decrease as much in untreated cells during ischemia. Our data indicate that it is the ratio of Bcl-2 family members that plays a critical role in determining ischemia-induced apoptosis. It is also important to note that ischemia-induced apoptosis involves the regulation of RNA and protein synthesis

	15011896, cute coronary syndrome and crystal methamphetamine use: a case series. Ice  is a form of methamphetamine commonly used as a recreational drug in Hawaii and the Philippines, but seldom encountered in the continental United States. It differs in appearance from methamphetamine tablets, but otherwise has exactly the same molecules, only arranged in a crystalline structure. A sizeable body of in vitro, animal, and autopsy data suggest a linkage between methamphetamine use and myocardial pathology. In this report, we describe a series of eight patients who developed unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction in association with smoking crystal methamphetamine. The findings, to a large extent, resemble those with cocaine-associated acute coronary syndromes. Given the widespread abuse of methamphetamine among young age groups, the recognition and primary prevention of cardiovascular toxic effects is of mounting socioeconomic importance

	15061561, eighborhood environment and opportunity to try methamphetamine ( ice ) and marijuana: evidence from Guam in the Western Pacific region of Micronesia.Although the American popular press and films might generally lead one to think otherwise, illegal drug use and drug trafficking occur outside the boundaries of disadvantaged American inner-city neighborhoods. Nonetheless, the occurrence of youthful drug involvement may be determined by similar community conditions in many parts of the world. In Spring 1998, a probability sample of 776 high school students living in Guam, Micronesia, completed a self-report anonymous survey, one that assessed their village and metropolitan neighborhood environments as well as drug involvement. On Guam, higher levels of neighborhood disadvantage were associated with youths being more likely to have been offered a chance to try drugs. This study adds new evidence on the potential importance of environmental and psychosocial contexts of neighborhood environment that might help account for the nonrandom distribution of youthful drug involvement

	1527658, rystal methamphetamine abuse: a concern to oral and maxillofacial surgeons.Synthetically manufactured methamphetamine ( ice,   crystal ) appears to be undergoing a rebirth in popularity because experienced drug users are reportedly unable to distinguish between the qualities of the cocaine and methamphetamine euphoria. Like cocaine, adverse drug reactions with therapeutic drugs used in dentistry have been reported, ranging from mild intoxication to sudden death. This article discusses the pharmacology of this illicit drug and the problems associated with its use in patients undergoing oral and maxillofacial surgery

	16769452, rug use and risk of HIV/AIDS on the Mexico-USA border: a comparison of treatment admissions in both countries.This study analyzes trends in treatment admissions and summarizes HIV/AIDS risk factors along the US-Mexican border. Data are presented at the national level and at the state level for states along the border. Client data also are compared for treatment programs located in sister cities on the Texas-Mexico border. These data show that methamphetamine admissions are increasing nationally and methamphetamine use is a major problem in the western states on both sides of the border. Use of Ice (smoked methamphetamine) has increased significantly. Use of crack (smoked cocaine) is a growing problem on the border, and injection is the primary route for using black tar heroin in this area. Each of these drugs is a risk factor, either from drug-influenced risky sexual behaviors or from sharing injection equipment. In addition, the availability of drugs on the border and patterns of risky behaviors among migrants mean that drug users on the border are at risk of HIV/AIDS, and this risk is expected to increase with the spreading methamphetamine epidemic and smoking of crack cocaine. Comparable data on HIV/AIDS are needed for further studies of the relationship of drug use and HIV/AIDS on the border

	17262233, Optic neuropathy induced by prenatal drug or alcohol exposure]PURPOSE: The main aim of this work was to analyse the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in retinal and optic nerve development, and the consequences of methamphetamine  ice  (MA) or alcohol (EtOH) abuse during pregnancy on the developing visual system. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Wistar rats were exposed to MA or EtOH during gestation and lactation and their offspring studied. Control isocaloric rats were maintained in parallel. The eyes and optic nerves from pups (at 7, 14 and 21 postnatal days) were processed using morphologic, morphometric and western blot approaches using antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), myelin basic protein (MBP) and neurofilament protein (NFP). RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were observed between the methamphetamine-exposed and the alcohol-exposed rats, as compared to the controls. The optic nerve cross-sectional area was smaller in the drug or alcohol-exposed animals. The expression of developmental protein markers (GFAP and MBP) in the retina and optic nerve displayed striking alterations related to drug or alcohol abuse during gestation and lactation. CONCLUSIONS: Psychostimulant and alcohol exposure alters the development of the retina and optic nerve

	1729423, ardiovascular effects of methamphetamine.Stimulant abuse has grown in popularity, particularly since the advent of crack cocaine. Another commonly abused drug is methamphetamine (MAP) hydrochloride. Known as crank, crystal, ice, crystal meth, and speed, MAP can be produced easily from ephedrine, and it is widely available. This article describes the pharmacology, cardiovascular effects, and toxicology of MAP, as well as the management principles of MAP abuse

	17364831, DMA, methamphetamine and their combination: possible lessons for party drug users from recent preclinical research.The substituted amphetamines 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'Ecstasy') and methamphetamine (METH, 'ice', 'speed') are increasingly popular drugs amongst party-drug users. Studies with humans have investigated the acute and possible long-term adverse effects of these drugs, yet outcomes of such studies are often ambiguous due to a variety of confounding factors. Studies employing animal models have value in determining the acute and long-term effects of MDMA and METH on brain and behaviour. Self-administration studies show that intravenous METH is a particularly potent reinforcer in rats and other species. In contrast, MDMA appears to have powerful effects in enhancing social behaviour in laboratory animals. Brief exposure to MDMA or METH may produce long-term reductions in dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline in the brain and alterations in the density of various receptor and transporter proteins. However it is still unclear, particularly in the case of MDMA, whether this reflects a 'neurotoxic' effect of the drug. Lasting alterations in social behaviour, anxiety, depressive symptoms and memory have been demonstrated in laboratory rats given MDMA or METH and this matches long-term changes reported in some human studies. Recent laboratory studies suggest that MDMA/METH combinations may produce greater adverse neurochemical and behavioural effects than either drug alone. This is of some concern given recent evidence that party drug users may be frequently exposed to this combination of drugs

	17536161, mokable ( ice ,  crystal meth ) and non smokable amphetamine-type stimulants: clinical pharmacological and epidemiological issues, with special reference to the UK. Ice ,  crystal meth , is the smokable form of methamphetamine hydrochloride. This paper will comment on the pharmacological, epidemiological, clinical and social issues related to smoking the drug as opposed to either its injection or ingestion. Furthermore, some data related to amphetamines/methamphetamines consumption, request for treatment, seizures, related offences and deaths in the UK (1990-2002) will be offered here. Peak rates, for most indicators, were reached at the end of the '90s, to fall down in the following years. The only indicator which seemed not to show any declining rates is number of deaths, but this may be related to a more general increase in stimulant death rates recently observed in the UK. It is argued that methamphetamines, and particularly  crystal meth , could reach the same prevalence levels of use in the UK as it is already in the US but recent reclassification of the drug to Class A in the UK could help to better control this emerging issue

	17934996, sian-Pacific Islander adolescent methamphetamine use: does ice increase aggression and sexual risks?Using a probability sample from a 2001 Youth Risk Behavior Survey of Asian-Pacific Islander youths in Guam, this brief study examined the outcomes for methamphetamine use on aggression and risky sexual activities. The results of the study indicated that both male and female adolescents who used methamphetamine were significantly more likely to participate in aggressive behaviors and sexual risks (i.e., numerous sex partners). The inclusion of grade point averages in a logistic regression equation revealed that White adolescents were more likely than other ethnicities to indicate that they had used methamphetamine and the inclusion of student grade point averages reduced male gender to nonsignificance. We also discuss the limitations of the study

	18021044, omparison of crystalline methamphetamine ( ice ) users and other patients with toxicology-related problems presenting to a hospital emergency department.OBJECTIVE: To compare demographic and clinical characteristics of methamphetamine users and patients with other toxicology-related problems requiring medical intervention in a hospital emergency department (ED). DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective observational study of toxicology-related presentations to the ED of St Vincent's Hospital (SVH), Sydney, an inner-city tertiary hospital, between 1 October and 31 December 2006. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences between methamphetamine-related and other toxicology-related presentations to the ED in relation to behaviour, mode of arrival, accompaniment, need for scheduling, location of drug use, intravenous drug use history, psychiatric history and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: During the study period there were 10 305 patient presentations to SVH ED; 449 (4%) were toxicology-related presentations, of which 100 (1% of total) were methamphetamine-related. Methamphetamine users were significantly more agitated, violent and aggressive than patients with other toxicology-related presentations and significantly less alert, communicative and cooperative (P &lt; 0.001); 24% of methamphetamine users (24/100) arrived with police accompaniment versus 9% of other toxicology patients (33/349) (P &lt; 0.001). Methamphetamine users were more likely to have a history of intravenous drug use and mental health problems (P &lt; 0.001); 39% of methamphetamine presentations (39/100) required scheduling under the Mental Health Act 1990 (NSW) compared with 19% of other toxicology-related presentations (67/349) (P &lt; 0.001); 43% of methamphetamine-related presentations (43/100) involved drug use on the street compared with 24% of other toxicology-related presentations (83/349) (P &lt; 0.001). Two-thirds of all methamphetamine users were male, and the most common age group for both male and female users was 26-30 years. The mean age and sex distribution of patients with other toxicology-related presentations were not significantly different. Among methamphetamine users, 27% of women (9/33) were in the 21-25-year age group compared with 10% (7/67) of men (P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: There were significant differences between methamphetamine-related and other toxicology-related presentations to SVH ED. Methamphetamine users were more aggressive, violent and dangerous, and thus more likely to pose a risk to health personnel and others. Methamphetamine appeared to be used consistently, rather than as an episodic  party drug 

	18082974,  comparison of the physiological, behavioral, neurochemical and microglial effects of methamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine in the mouse.3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and methamphetamine (METH) are amphetamine analogues with similar persistent neurochemical effects in the mouse which some have described as neurotoxicity. We attempted to identify dose regimens of MDMA and METH with similar effects on behavioral and physiological variables in the mouse, then quantified the effects of these dose regimens on neurochemistry and microglial markers. Four discrete injections of saline, MDMA (10, 20, or 30 mg/kg), or METH (5 or 10 mg/kg) were administered to mice at 2 h intervals. Body weight was quantified immediately before each injection, and 2 h after the last injection, while core temperature and locomotor activity were continuously monitored via radiotelemetry. Mice were killed 72 h after the final injection and brains were rapidly dissected on ice. Dopamine content in various brain regions was quantified via high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), and microglial activation was assessed by saturation binding of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligand 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide ([(3)H]PK11195). Specific dose regimens of MDMA and METH induced similar reductions in body weight, depletions of dopamine and its metabolites, and similar hyperthermic and locomotor stimulant effects, but only METH activated microglia in striatum. These results suggest that repeated high doses of MDMA and METH that produce hyperthermia, locomotor stereotypy, weight loss and neurochemical depletion are not consistently accompanied by microglial activation. The finding that METH, but not MDMA, induces microglial effects in the striatum consistent with neurotoxicity might imply different mechanisms of toxic action for these two psychostimulants

	18368603, he prevalence of methamphetamine and amphetamine abuse in North America: a review of the indicators, 1992-2007.INTRODUCTION: This paper reviews epidemiological information about methamphetamine production and use in North America. METHODS: Information is drawn from a range of sources, including, but not limited to, historical accounts, peer-reviewed papers, population surveys and large national databases. RESULTS: Methamphetamine and amphetamine use in North America is characterised by geographic variations, with different types of the drug, different routes of administration and different types of users at various times. Unlike some other drug use patterns in North America, the nature of methamphetamine use in Canada, Mexico and the United States has been linked closely in terms of production and supply of the drug. According to their national household surveys, the annual prevalence for 'speed' use in Canada was 0.8% in 2004, 0.3% for 'anfetaminas' and 0.1% for 'metanfetaminas' in Mexico in 2002, and 1.4% for 'stimulants' in the United States in 2006. DISCUSSION: Although the data sources in the three North American countries are not consistent in methodology, terminology or frequency of reporting, all show similar trends. The type of stimulant most used has shifted from non-medical use of pharmaceutical amphetamine to use of powder methamphetamine and then to use of 'ice'. The indicators show the problem is greatest in the western parts of the countries and is moving eastward, but the decreased availability of pseudoephedrine may have a significant impact on the nature of the epidemic in the future. Nevertheless, use of methamphetamine poses a number of risks for users and specialised treatment resources for these various populations are needed

	18803173, Ice  use and eating disorders: a report of three cases.OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of crystal methamphetamine hydrochloride  ice,  a powerful, synthetic stimulant drug associated with rapid weight loss. METHOD: We report the first three cases of young women  ice  users requiring admission to a specialized eating disorders unit. RESULTS: Case one had no prior history of an eating disorder and became emaciated following regular use of  ice ; she regarded weight gain positively. Case 2 had polysubstance abuse since early adolescence and commenced binge eating and vomiting in response to weight gain when not using  ice ; she learned to maintain her weight without weight losing behaviors. Case 3 developed anorexia nervosa in early adolescence, required numerous inpatient admissions and commenced using stimulant drugs for weight loss in her late teens; she discharged prematurely. All patients had features of personality disorder on interview and drug abuse had impaired their work and social adjustment. DISCUSSION:  Ice  use may be associated with the onset of disordered eating or used as an efficient weight losing behavior in an established eating disorder

	1886456, linical effects of methamphetamine vapor inhalation.Despite the increasing popularity of crystalline methamphetamine ( ice ) vapor inhalation, no investigations have reported drug plasma concentrations and effects. Under controlled laboratory conditions, six subjects were studied. Plasma concentrations of methamphetamine were determined, and subjective and cardiovascular effects were measured. Methamphetamine appeared in plasma rapidly, increased slowly over the next four hours and then progressively declined. The dose of methamphetamine administered produced modest ratings of subjective drug effects, and moderate changes in cardiovascular parameters. Both subjective and cardiovascular effects rapidly decreased despite the presence of sustained concentrations of methamphetamine in plasma

	19207353, mpact of US and Canadian precursor regulation on methamphetamine purity in the United States.AIMS: Reducing drug purity is a major, but largely unstudied, goal of drug suppression. This study examines whether US methamphetamine purity was impacted by the suppression policy of US and Canadian precursor chemical regulation. DESIGN: Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)-intervention time-series analysis. SETTING: Continental United States and Hawaii (1985-May 2005). Interventions US federal regulations targeting precursors, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, in forms used by large-scale producers were implemented in November 1989, August 1995 and October 1997. US regulations targeting precursors in forms used by small-scale producers (e.g. over-the-counter medications) were implemented in October 1996 and October 2001. Canada implemented federal precursor regulations in January 2003 and July 2003 and an essential chemical (e.g. acetone) regulation in January 2004. MEASUREMENTS: Monthly median methamphetamine purity series. FINDINGS: US regulations targeting large-scale producers were associated with purity declines of 16-67 points; those targeting small-scale producers had little or no impact. Canada's precursor regulations were associated with purity increases of 13-15 points, while its essential chemical regulation was associated with a 13-point decrease. Hawaii's purity was consistently high, and appeared to vary little with the 1990s/2000s regulations. CONCLUSIONS: US precursor regulations targeting large-scale producers were associated with substantial decreases in continental US methamphetamine purity, while regulations targeting over-the-counter medications had little or no impact. Canada's essential chemical regulation was also associated with a decrease in continental US purity. However, Canada's precursor regulations were associated with purity increases: these regulations may have impacted primarily producers of lower-quality methamphetamine, leaving higher-purity methamphetamine on the market by default. Hawaii's well-known preference for 'ice' (high-purity methamphetamine) may have helped to constrain purity there to a high, attenuated range, possibly limiting its sensitivity to precursor regulation

	19622171, rug use patterns among Thai illicit drug injectors amidst increased police presence.Thailand has traditionally pursued an aggressive enforcement-based anti-illicit drug policy in an effort to make the country  drug-free.  In light of this ongoing approach, we sought to assess impacts of enforcement on drug use behaviors among a cohort of injection drug users (IDU) in Thailand. We examined drug use patterns among IDU participating in a cross-sectional study conducted in Bangkok (n = 252). Participants were asked to provide data regarding patterns of drug use in the previous six months, including types of drugs consumed, method of consumption, frequency of use, and weekly income spent on drugs. We also conducted bivariate analyses to identify a possible effect of a reported increase in police presence on measures of drug use and related risk behaviors among study participants. One hundred fifty-five (61.5%) individuals reported injection heroin use and 132 (52.4%) individuals reported injection midazolam use at least daily in the past six months. Additionally, 86 (34.1%) individuals reported at least daily injection Yaba and Ice (i.e., methamphetamine) use. Participants in our study reported high levels of illicit drug use, including the injection of both illicit and licit drugs. In bivariate analyses, no association between increased police presence and drug use behaviors was observed. These findings demonstrate high ongoing rates of drug injecting in Thailand despite reports of increased levels of strict enforcement and enforcement-related violence, and raise questions regarding the merits of this approach

	1996001, ardiomyopathy associated with the smoking of crystal methamphetamine.The smoking of crystal methamphetamine, or  ice,  is a growing drug abuse problem in the United States. The toxic effects of methamphetamine smoking have not been well described. We describe two patients with cardiovascular toxic effects associated with the smoking of crystal methamphetamine. In our first patient, the use of smokeable methamphetamine was associated with the subsequent development of pulmonary edema and a dilated cardiomyopathy. In our second patient, the smoking of crystal methamphetamine likely produced diffuse vasospasm that resulted in acute myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, and death. The recognition of potentially lethal cardiac complications associated with the smoking of crystal methamphetamine is of extreme significance and should be emphasized to potential abusers of this drug

	2085287, Methamphetamine abuse by smoking]Three cases of methamphetamine abuse by smoking were reported. The oral intake and the intravenous injection of the drug are usually adopted, and the smoking is recently found among the stimulant abusers in Japan. The stimulant is heated on a piece of aluminium foil with a lighter and its smoke is inhaled with a straw or a paper pipe. The intake means are identical to  crystal or ice  in Hawaii, although a special glass pipe or a cigarette is not used here. The effect of the drug obtained by smoking is more slack and mild than that by a intravenous injection, although the drug of the double dose is used in the smoking. Two cases changed the intake means from the injection to the smoking because of no guilty feeling and a lack of injection marks and evident proofs of illegal use. Therefore, abuse of methamphetamine by smoking is thought to increase in near future in Japan, and the delusion of arrest by policemen observed frequently in the stimulant abusers maybe decreases as a result of a decrease in the psychological stress of guilty

	2293467, ethamphetamine. Stimulant of the 1990s?During the past several years, the use of a smokable form of methamphetamine hydrochloride called  ice  has increased rapidly. The heaviest use has occurred on the West Coast and in Hawaii. Many regional emergency departments treat more methamphetamine users than cocaine-intoxicated patients. The ease of synthesis from inexpensive and readily available chemicals makes possible the rampant abuse of a dangerous drug that can produce a euphoria similar to that induced by cocaine. Clinicians should be familiar with the medical effects and treatment of acute methamphetamine toxicity

	2592191, rystal methamphetamine-induced acute pulmonary edema: a case report. Crystal methamphetamine  is a crystalline form of amphetamine, the abuse of which is growing rapidly in popularity in Japan, Hawaii and the West Coast. Drug experts and law enforcement officials say that the use of crystal meth is spreading east from California. It may produce permanent addiction and can produce violent schizophrenic behavior. Introduced along the Leeward Coast of Hawaii about 3 years ago, it is now being used throughout Oahu and is starting to rival cocaine as the illicit drug of choice in Hawaii. It is also the major drug problem in Japan, where the powder form is called  shabu.  The smoking of crystal ( ice ) in a glass pipe is more common in Hawaii, whereas other routes of administration, such as snorting or intravenous use, are more common on the West Coast. We present the case of a young woman who was admitted to Kaiser Moanalua Medical Center with near fatal acute pulmonary edema consequent to the use of crystal meth

	7476843, ncreasing morbidity and mortality associated with abuse of methamphetamine--United States, 1991-1994.Methamphetamine (also known as  speed,   crystal,   crank,   go,  and  ice ) is the most widely illegally manufactured, distributed, and abused type of amphetamine, a class of stimulant drugs. An estimated 4 million persons in the United States have abused methamphetamine at least once (1). Information from several sources--including medical examiners, hospital emergency departments (EDs), substance-abuse-treatment facilities, and community epidemiologists--suggests a recent increase in morbidity and mortality associated with abuse of methamphetamine in the United States, primarily in the West but also in the South and Midwest. To characterize trends in methamphetamine-associated morbidity and mortality during 1991-1994, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) compiled and analyzed data from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) and the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS). This report summarizes the results of these analyses

	7840041, mokable methamphetamine ('ice'): an old drug in a different form.Methamphetamine has long been a drug of abuse. The smokable form of methamphetamine hydrochloride, called  ice  on the street, is twice as toxic as amphetamine and has clinical effects similar to those of cocaine. In the United States, methamphetamine use has spread eastward from Hawaii and California. Ice is a strong central nervous system stimulant. Chronic use may result in serious psychiatric, cardiovascular, metabolic and neuromuscular changes. Generally, patients presenting with methamphetamine toxicity can be treated conservatively in the emergency department. Long-term treatment usually requires drug rehabilitation and inpatient counseling

	7932687, e>Ice--a new drug of concern?Methamphetamine has long been a drug of abuse. Recently, a resurgence of its use has spread across the country. A smokable form of methamphetamine hydrochloride with the street name  ice  has spread eastward from Hawaii and California. It has strong stimulant properties, is twice as toxic as amphetamine, is associated with multiple system effects similar to cocaine. Treatment of acute intoxication is symptomatic and may include hydration, temperature regulation, seizure management, control of agitation, and monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias. Long-term treatment of addiction requires drug rehabilitation and inpatient counseling

	8104133, harmacokinetics of methamphetamine self-administered to human subjects by smoking S-(+)-methamphetamine hydrochloride.S-(+)-methamphetamine hydrochloride ( ice ) is abused by smoking (inhaling the vapors of the material). Male human volunteers inhaled the drug from a pipe heated at 300 degrees-305 degrees C for an average inhaled dose of 21.8 +/- 0.3 (SE) mg. The same volunteers were given an intravenous injection of 15.5 mg of S-(+)-methamphetamine hydrochloride. Methamphetamine and its metabolite amphetamine were analyzed in plasma, saliva, and urine by gas chromatography. The bioavailability of smoked methamphetamine was 90.3 +/- 10.4%. (Oral bioavailability calculated from this study and a previous one was 67.2 +/- 3.1%). The geometric mean plasma half-life was 11.1 hr for smoked methamphetamine and 12.2 hr for the intravenous drug. These values agreed with urinary excretion rate data. The volume of distribution in the elimination phase was 3.24 +/- 0.36 liter/kg for the smoked dose and 3.73 +/- 0.59 liter/kg for the intravenous dose. The mean residence times were 11.5 +/- 0.5 hr and 11.3 +/- 1.74 hr for the two routes. Metabolic clearance represented 58 and 55%, respectively, of the total clearance. Significant amounts of the drug (37-45% of the nominal dose) were excreted in urine as methamphetamine and lesser amounts (7% of the nominal molar dose) as amphetamine. Renal clearance was equivalent for the two routes. Methamphetamine concentrations in plasma after inhalation showed a plateau. A model involving both a fast and a slow input function fit the data from 4 of the 6 subjects and indicated a terminal elimination rate that agreed with results from model-independent pharmacokinetic calculations. The drug caused significant subjective and cardiovascular effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS

	8610803, ecurrent corneal ulcerations associated with smokeable methamphetamine abuse.PURPOSE: We studied a case of chronic, recurrent, bilateral, corneal ulcerations associated with smokeable methamphetamine abuse, commonly known as  ice,  in an otherwise healthy 31-year-old woman. METHODS: Every few months the patient had recurrent corneal ulcerations. Each time, she was hospitalized and treated successfully with topical antibiotics. RESULTS: Even though she had undergone numerous formal attempts at drug rehabilitation, she continued to have relapses, and ulceration recurred only during periods of smokeable methamphetamine abuse. CONCLUSION: Illicit use of smokeable methamphetamine may result in corneal ulceration

	9063008, ethamphetamine abuse: an overview for health care professionals.Methamphetamine is a stimulant and drug of abuse. Its use has shown a recent reemergence nationwide, most notably in Hawaii.

	15726604, oinheritance of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations with Fanconi anemia and Bloom syndrome mutations in Ashkenazi Jewish population: possible role in risk modification for cancer development.Fanconi anemia (FA) and Bloom syndrome (BS) are rare autosomal recessive genetic disorders manifesting in childhood, with a predisposition to cancer development in adolescence and adulthood. Both syndromes are relatively prevalent among the Ashkenazi Jewish population, and, in both syndromes, mutations specific to this population have been identified. Similarly, unique Ashkenazi mutations were found in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. These two genes, when mutated, play important roles in familial breast and ovarian carcinogenesis. The genes involved in the pathogenesis of the FA and BS belong to the general class of instability genes. Heterozygosity for the FA gene has no known promalignant potential, while the BS mutation carrier state was associated with an increased frequency of colorectal cancer. The especially frequent carrier state among the Ashkenazi Jewish population coupled with the high prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the same population has led us to search for coinheritance affecting the potential for cancer development. One hundred Ashkenazi women with known BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were screened for the FA mutation IVS4+4 A--&gt;T and the BS mutation blm(Ash). Our results indicate that there is an increased prevalence of both FA and BS mutation carriers among the population studied compared with the general Ashkenazi population (prevalence of FA mutation 4/100 women [4%] as compared to 35/3104 previously published controls [1.1%], P=0.031, and for BS mutation 3/100 [3.2%] as compared to 36/4001 [0.9%], P=0.058). There was no statistically significant effect of the coinheritance on cancer prevalence, type of cancer, or age of cancer onset. Coinheritance of FA and/or BS mutations seems to be more prevalent among BRCA mutation carriers, but a larger study encompassing more women may help in clarifying this issue

	16387452, loom's syndrome gene-deficient phenotype in mouse primary cells induced by a modified tetracycline-controlled trans-silencer.We recently reported genome-wide bi-allelic mutagenesis and phenotype-based genetic screening by tetracycline-regulated disruption of the Bloom's syndrome gene (Blm) in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. However, the same approach was hampered in mouse tissues owing to leaky expression of the Blm gene, which is the major obstacle in the tetracycline regulatory system. Here we describe a single-chain reverse tetracycline-controlled trans-silencer (sc rtTS) which reduces leaky expression in the tet-off system. The sc rtTS consists of two silencer moieties linked by a 36 amino acid linker. Although the silencer moiety contained a dimerization domain compatible with the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA), heterodimerization with tTA was prevented because intramolecular self-assembly between linked silencer moieties was preferred. The system was applied to mouse splenic lymphocytes and elevation of sister chromatid exchange, the hallmark of Blm dysfunction, was observed in the presence of doxycycline. A cassette containing both sc rtTS and tTA was introduced into the Blm allele in ES cells and reduction of basal activity was observed upon doxycycline treatment. Our data demonstrate effectiveness of sc rtTS in the tet-off system. Application of sc rtTS in mice may allow us to implement bi-allelic mutagenesis in vivo

	16858412, umor suppressor gene identification using retroviral insertional mutagenesis in Blm-deficient mice.Retroviral insertional mutagenesis preferentially identifies oncogenes rather than tumor suppressor (TS) genes, presumably because a single retroviral-induced mutation is sufficient to activate an oncogene and initiate a tumor, whereas two mutations are needed to inactivate a TS gene. Here we show that TS genes can be identified by insertional mutagenesis when the screens are performed in Blm-deficient backgrounds. Blm-deficient mice, like Bloom syndrome patients, have increased frequencies of mitotic recombination owing to a mutation in the RecQ protein-like-3 helicase gene. This increased mitotic recombination increases the likelihood that an insertional mutation in one allele of a TS gene will become homozygoused by non-sister chromatid exchange and the homozygosity of the insertion provides a marker for identifying the TS gene. We also show that known as well as novel TS genes can be identified by insertional mutagenesis in Blm-deficient mice and identify two JmjC family proteins that contribute to genome stability in species as evolutionarily diverse as mammals and Caenorhabditis elegans

	19537173, Direct site-specific cleavage of double-stranded DNA by conjugates of bleomycin A5 with triplex-forming oligonucleotide]Monofunctional conjugates of 15-mer triplex-forming oligonucleotide (TFO) with covalently attached bleomycin A5 residue at the 5'-end (Blm-p15) were synthesized. Bifunctional conjugates of TFO containing, in addition to Blm, the residues of intercalator 6-chloro-2-methoxy-9-aminoacridine (Acr) or (N-(2-hydroxyethyl)phenazinium (Phn) were obtained for the first time. The Acr and Phn residues were attached to the 3'-phosphate group of TFO through L1 and L2 linkers, respectively, resulting in the compounds Blm-p15pL1-Acr and Blm-p15pL2-Phn. The values of dissociation constants of the corresponding triplexes were evaluated using the gel retardation method. The Acr residue in Blm-p15pL1-Acr was shown to enhance the stability of the formed triplex by one order of magnitude. It was demonstrated that all synthesized conjugates are capable of specifically and nonspecifically damaging a target DNA, forming direct breaks and alkaline-labile sites. The extent of the specific cleavage of the target DNA was 15% in the case of a fivefold excess of the conjugates over the DNA duplex. The site-specific triplex-mediated cleavage of a target DNA was shown for the first time to occur predominantly (&gt; 90%) with the formation of the direct breaks of both DNA strands. The results show the availability of bleomycin-containing oligonucleotides as antigene compounds

	17264084, eural stem/progenitor cells express 20 tenascin C isoforms that are differentially regulated by Pax6.Tenascin C (Tnc) is an alternatively spliced, multimodular extracellular matrix glycoprotein present in the ventricular zone of the developing brain. Pax6-deficient small eye (sey) mouse mutants show an altered Tnc expression pattern. Here, we investigated the expression of Tnc isoforms in neural stem/progenitor cells and their regulation by the paired-box transcription factor Pax6. Neural stem/progenitor cells cultured as neurospheres strongly expressed Tnc on the protein level. The Tnc isoform expression in neural stem/progenitor cells was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-PCR and dot blot Southern hybridization. In total, 20 different Tnc isoforms were detected in neurospheres derived from embryonic fore-brain cell suspensions. The Tnc isoform containing the fibronectin type III domains A1A4BD is novel and might be neural stem/progenitor cell-specific. Transient overexpression of Pax6 in neurospheres of the medial ganglionic eminence did not alter the total Tnc mRNA expression level but showed a pronounced regulative effect on different Tnc isoforms. The larger Tnc isoforms containing four, five, and six additional alternatively spliced fibronectin type III domains were up-regulated, whereas the small Tnc isoforms without any or with one additional domain were down-regulated. Thus, Pax6 is a homeodomain protein that also modulates the splicing machinery. We conclude that the combinatorial code of Tnc isoform expression in the neural stem/progenitor cell is complex and regulated by Pax6. These findings suggest a functional significance for individual Tnc isoforms in neural stem/progenitor cells

	18160825, enascin C in stem cell niches: redundant, permissive or instructive?The stem cell niche provides the specialized environment that is able to sustain the lifelong maintenance of stem cells in their discrete locations within organs. The niche is usually composed of several different cell types and a specialized extracellular matrix consisting of many different constituents. Additionally, a variety of growth factors are secreted into the extracellular space and contribute to the functional organization of the niche. Here, I will concentrate on the multimodular extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin C (Tnc) and discuss it as an exemplary molecule that is present in several stem cell niches. In spite of its intuitively suggestive presence, it has been difficult to provide functional evidence for the importance of Tnc in the context of stem cells. In the nervous system, the careful analysis of Tnc-deficient mice has revealed that the developmental program neural stem cell pass-through is delayed due to changes in growth factor responsiveness. To gain further insight, we have employed the gene trap technology in neural stem cells to identify potential Tnc target genes. This approach has surfaced 2 interesting candidates that may contribute to a better understanding of the signal(s) elicited by Tnc in neural stem/progenitor cells in the niche

	18617690, n induction gene trap screen in neural stem cells reveals an instructive function of the niche and identifies the splicing regulator sam68 as a tenascin-C-regulated target gene.Neural stem cells (NSCs) reside in a niche that abounds in extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules. The ECM glycoprotein tenascin-C (Tnc) that occurs in more than 25 isoforms represents a major constituent of the privileged NSC milieu. To understand its role for NSCs, the induction gene trap technology was successfully applied to mouse embryonic NSCs, and a library of more than 500 NSC lines with independent gene trap vector integrations was established. Our pilot screen identified Sam68 as a target of Tnc signaling in NSCs. The Tnc-mediated downregulation of Sam68, which we found expressed at low levels in the niche along with Tnc, was independently confirmed on the protein level. Sam68 is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein, and its potential significance for cultured NSCs was studied by overexpression. Increased Sam68 levels caused a marked reduction in NSC cell proliferation. In addition, Sam68 is a signal-dependent regulator of alternative splicing, and its overexpression selectively increased the larger Tnc isoforms, whereas a mutated phosphorylation-deficient Sam68 variant did not. This emphasizes the importance of Sam68 for NSC biology and implicates an instructive rather than a purely permissive role for Tnc in the neural stem cell niche

	19394429, enascin-C stimulates contactin-dependent neurite outgrowth via activation of phospholipase C.Tenascin-C (Tnc) is transiently expressed during neural development. Within its alternatively spliced fibronectin type III (TNfn) -motifs the TNfnD domain is crucial for a neurite outgrowth-promoting region that is recognized by the GPI-linked adhesion molecule of the Ig-superfamily contactin. In order to understand the downstream signaling mechanisms, embryonic day E18 rat hippocampal neurons were cultivated on TNfnBD-containing and control substrates in the presence of various inhibitors. As predicted, axon outgrowth promotion could be suppressed by antibodies to the TNfnD domain, to contactin, or to the beta1-integrin subunit. The chelators BAPTA/AM or EGTA as well as blockade of membrane-based calcium channels or of the release of calcium from intracellular stores reduced axon growth to control levels. The inhibition of phospholipase C and its downstream targets protein kinase C or calmodulin kinase likewise blocked outgrowth promotion. We propose that TNfnBD stimulates the outgrowth of hippocampal neurons by activating calcium- and phospholipase C-depending pathways. Digital video microscopy studies revealed that increase of fiber length was caused by an augmentation of growth cone velocity

	19459213, enascin C and tenascin R similarly prevent the formation of myelin membranes in a RhoA-dependent manner, but antagonistically regulate the expression of myelin basic protein via a separate pathway.Membrane formation and the initiation of myelin gene expression are hallmarks of the differentiation of oligodendrocytes from their precursors. Here, we compared the roles of the two related extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins Tenascin C (Tnc) and Tenascin R (Tnr) in oligodendrocyte differentiation. Oligodendrocyte precursors from Tnr-deficient mice exhibited reduced differentiation, as revealed by retarded expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) in culture. This could be rescued with purified Tnr. In contrast, when we cultured oligodendrocytes on a Tnc-containing, astrocyte-derived ECM, they barely expressed MBP. This inhibition could be overcome when we used ECM from astrocytes deficient for Tnc, suggesting that Tnc inhibits differentiation. In contrast to their antagonistic effect on differentiation, both Tnc and Tnr similarly inhibited morphologic maturation. When oligodendrocytes were cultured on the purified glycoproteins, process elaboration and membrane expansion were reduced. Both Tnc and Tnr interfered with the activation of the small GTPase RhoA. Conversely, RhoA and Rac1 activation induced by cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) increased the formation of myelin membranes, whereas Y27632-mediated inhibition of the Rho-cascade prevented it without, however, affecting the fraction of MBP-expressing cells. Because Tnc and Tnr play antagonistic roles for differentiation and comparably inhibit morphologic maturation, we conclude that independent molecular pathways regulate these processes

	19508743, he glia-derived extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-C promotes embryonic and postnatal retina axon outgrowth via the alternatively spliced fibronectin type III domain TNfnD.Tenascin-C (Tnc) is an astrocytic multifunctional extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein that potentially promotes or inhibits neurite outgrowth. To investigate its possible functions for retinal development, explants from embryonic day 18 (E18) rat retinas were cultivated on culture substrates composed of poly-d-lysine (PDL), or PDL additionally coated with Tnc or laminin (LN)-1, which significantly increased fiber length. When combined with LN, Tnc induced axon fasciculation that reduced the apparent number of outgrowing fibers. In order to circumscribe the stimulatory region, Tnc-derived fibronectin type III (TNfn) domains fused to the human Ig-Fc-fragment TNfnD6-Fc, TNfnBD-Fc, TNFnA1A2-Fc and TNfnA1D-Fc were studied. The fusion proteins TNfnBD-Fc and to a lesser degree TNfnA1D-Fc were stimulatory when compared with the Ig-Fc-fragment protein without insert. In contrast, the combination TNfnA1A2-Fc reduced fiber outgrowth beneath the values obtained for the Ig-Fc domain, indicating potential inhibitory properties. The monoclonal J1/tn2 antibody (clone 578) that is specific for domain TNfnD blocked the stimulatory properties of the TNfn-Fc fusions. When postnatal day 7 retinal ganglion cells were used rather that explants, Tnc and Tnc-derived proteins proved permissive for neurite outgrowth. The present study highlights a strong retinal axon growth-promoting activity of the Tnc domain TNfnD, which is modulated by neighboring domains

	19561617, enascin-C is an endogenous activator of Toll-like receptor 4 that is essential for maintaining inflammation in arthritic joint disease.Although there have been major advances in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with the advent of biological agents, the mechanisms that drive cytokine production and sustain disease chronicity remain unknown. Tenascin-C (encoded by Tnc) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein specifically expressed at areas of inflammation and tissue damage in inflamed rheumatoid joints. Here we show that mice that do not express tenascin-C show rapid resolution of acute joint inflammation and are protected from erosive arthritis. Intra-articular injection of tenascin-C promotes joint inflammation in vivo in mice, and addition of exogenous tenascin-C induces cytokine synthesis in explant cultures from inflamed synovia of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. Moreover, in human macrophages and fibroblasts from synovia of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, tenascin-C induces synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines via activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Thus, we have identified tenascin-C as a novel endogenous activator of TLR4-mediated immunity that mediates persistent synovial inflammation and tissue destruction in arthritic joint disease

	19641104, enascin-C is an inhibitory boundary molecule in the developing olfactory bulb.We recently described the boundary-like expression pattern of the extracellular matrix molecule tenascin-C (Tnc) in the developing mouse olfactory bulb (OB) (Shay et al., 2008). In the present study, we test the hypothesis that Tnc inhibits olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) axon growth in the developing OB before glomerulogenesis. The period of time before glomerular formation begins, when axons remain restricted to the developing olfactory nerve layer (ONL), is crucial for axon sorting. Here, we show with in vitro analyses that OSN neurite outgrowth is inhibited by Tnc in a dose-dependent manner and that, in stripe assays, axons preferentially avoid Tnc. Using Tnc-null mice, we also show that that glomerular development is delayed in the absence of Tnc. In wild-type mice, OSN axons coalesce into immature or protoglomeruli, which further differentiate and segregate into glomeruli. Glomeruli are first identifiable as discrete structures at birth. In null mice, glomeruli appear immature at birth, remain fused to the ONL, and have a significantly larger diameter compared with wild-type controls. By postnatal day 4, null glomeruli are indistinguishable from controls. Thus, OSN axons appear delayed in their coalescence into glomerular structures. These data correlate with behavioral reports of Tnc-null mice, which are delayed by 24 h in their acquisition of an olfactory behavior (de Chevigny et al., 2006). Collectively, these data demonstrate that Tnc is an inhibitory boundary molecule in the developing OB during a key period of development

	19690384, nt signaling regulates smooth muscle precursor development in the mouse lung via a tenascin C/PDGFR pathway.Paracrine signaling from lung epithelium to the surrounding mesenchyme is important for lung SMC development and function and is a contributing factor in an array of pulmonary diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary hypertension, and asthma. Wnt7b, which is exclusively expressed in the lung epithelium, is important for lung vascular smooth muscle integrity, but the underlying mechanism by which Wnt signaling regulates lung SMC development is unclear. In this report, we have demonstrated that Wnt7b regulates a program of mesenchymal differentiation in the mouse lung that is essential for SMC development. Genetic loss-of-function studies showed that Wnt7b and beta-catenin were required for expression of Pdgfralpha and Pdgfrbeta and proliferation in pulmonary SMC precursors. In contrast, gain-of-function studies showed that activation of Wnt signaling increased the expression of both Pdgfralpha and Pdgfrbeta as well as the proliferation of SMC precursors. We further showed that the effect on Pdgfr expression was, in part, mediated by direct transcriptional regulation of the ECM protein tenascin C (Tnc), which was necessary and sufficient for Pdgfralpha/beta expression in lung explants. Moreover, this pathway was highly upregulated in a mouse model of asthma and in lung tissue from patients with pulmonary hypertension. Together, these data define a Wnt/Tnc/Pdgfr signaling axis that is critical for smooth muscle development and disease progression in the lung

	16595952, rotective effects of a neutral polysaccharide isolated from the mycelium of Antrodia cinnamomea on Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide induced hepatic injury in mice.Mycelia of Antrodia cinnamomea were extracted with chloroform and hot water. A neutral polysaccharide named ACN2a separated from the water extract was purified using 10% CCl3COOH, and repeated column chromatography on HW-65 and DE-52 cellulose. Its structure was determined by chemical and spectroscopic analyses. ACN2a was composed of Gal, Glc, Fuc, Man and GalN (in the ratio 1:0.24:0.07:0.026:faint), in which an alpha-D-(1--&gt;6)-Gal linkage accounted for 73% of all linkages. The ratio of branch points was about 16% of the total residual numbers, and branches were attached to C-2 of galactosyl residues of the main chain. ACN2a had an average molecular weight of 12.9x10(5) Daltons, [alpha]D25=+115 degrees (c=0.44, H2O); [eta]=0.0417dl.g-1, Cp=0.2663 cal/(g. degrees C). The hepatoprotective effect of ACN2a was evaluated using a mouse model of hepatic injury that was induced by Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The administration of ACN2a (0.4, 0.8 g/kg/d, p.o.), significantly prevented increases in serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) enzyme activities in mice treated with P. acnes-LPS, indicating hepatoprotective activity in vivo

	16777429, asolabial symmetry following Tennison-Randall lip repair: a three-dimensional approach in 10-year-old patients with unilateral clefts of lip, alveolus and palate.AIM: To assess the degree of facial symmetry in patients suffering from unilateral cleft lip, alveolus and palate (UCLAP) by determining differences between the cleft and the non-cleft hemifaces from 3D surface data. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In twenty-two 10-year-old UCLAP patients, who had the lip repaired using the Tennison-Randall technique and did not undergo further revisional surgery, differences were determined between landmarks, surface areas of the upper lip vermilion and nostrils and virtual volumes of midface, nose and upper lip for cleft and non-cleft sides, separately, after having established a plane of symmetry calculated from optical 3D facial surface data. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences could be found between cleft and non-cleft sides for the nasal landmarks G(lat), G(sup) and La(med), the nostril angle and the virtual volume of the nose (p(Glat)=0.011, p(Gsup)&lt;0.0005, p(Lamed)=0.002, p(nostril angle)=0.036 and p(nose volume)&lt;0.0005, resp.). CONCLUSION: Analysis of 3D data shows that complete nasal symmetry is difficult to achieve with Tennison-Randall's lip repair without revisional surgery. Further trials on larger populations of patients will allow a more comprehensive and consistent analysis of the consequence of different methods for cp repair in order to identify the techniques with the best outcome in terms of facial symmetry

	1723083, nhibition of NK cell generation by Corynebacterium parvum.Treatment of mice with Corynebacterium parvum (Cp) resulted in a substantial decrease of splenic NK activity associated with a reduced number of LGL. Cp also inhibited in vitro augmentation of NK cytotoxicity by IFN or IL-2 as well as generation of LAK activity. Localization experiments by using radiolabelled LGL indicated that the lower number of LGL in the spleen was not attributable to a Cp-induced alteration of LGL homing. Finally Cp was found to affect the ability of bone marrow cells to reconstitute NK activity in lethally irradiated mice, indicating that it can interfere with development of NK cells from bone marrow progenitors

	2148342, haracterization of Corynebacterium parvum-induced suppressor cells of mouse NK and ADCC activity.Treatment of mice with Corynebacterium parvum (Cp) resulted in a substantial decrease in natural killer activity in the spleen at 10 days. The decrease in cytotoxicity was associated with the presence of splenic nonadherent (NA) suppressor cells, capable of inhibiting natural as well as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The nonadherent suppressor cells appeared to be null cells, lacking detectable expression of Thy 1, L3T4 (CD4), Lyt 2 (CD8), or asialo-GM1 and could be physically separated from cells with NK activity by centrifugation on Percoll discontinuous density gradients. Our results indicate that Cp can negatively modulate cytolytic functions of NK cells by inhibiting the effector phase of cytotoxicity

	3118558, ncomplete surgery, local immunostimulation, and recurrence of some tumour types in dogs and cats.Histologically confirmed inadequate treatment resulted in a lower than expected recurrence percentage in dogs with haemangiopericytoma (38%) and mastocytoma (30%). Clinical suspicion of inadequate tumour treatment did not always correlate with the histologically assessed inadequacy, nor with the appearance of local recurrence. Local recurrence did not seem to be correlated with histological grade of malignancy and tumour size. Local injection of C. parvum vaccine did not result in a lower percentage of local recurrence or longer recurrence-free intervals in any of the three tumour groups (canine haemangiopericytoma, canine mastocytoma, feline mammary carcinoma). Nor was palliative local adjuvant injection of Cp successful in dogs and cats with soft tissue sarcomas or in dogs with gingival melanoma. Re-operation of locally recurrent tumour was successful in some dogs with haemangiopericytoma, in a few with mastocytoma, but not in cats with mammary carcinoma. A trend toward histological progression of recurrences and metastases, when compared with the primary tumours, was not evident. The possible reasons for the relatively low recurrence rate of some tumour types and for the failure of Cp-treatment are discussed

	3857405, mmunomodulation of NK and ADCC by Corynebacterium parvum in acute myeloid leukaemia patients.Natural killer (NK)- and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity assays were performed using cryopreserved effector cells in AML patients receiving i.c. and s.c. injections of Corynebacterium parvum. A dose related increase in NK could be demonstrated with peaks in NK at day 1 with full Cp dosage and at day 14 with 50% doses. This increase was attributable to the Cp vaccine since normal donors receiving tetanus toxoid or pneumococcal polysaccharide and AML patients randomized not to receive Cp did not show similar NK boosting. The increase was probably due to interferon induction in vivo and could be demonstrated with purified T- and non-T-lymphocyte subsets. However, longitudinal measurements showed that the ability of Cp to boost NK was gradually lost over 4-6 months. ADCC studies showed that while lymphocyte-ADCC was not consistently affected by Cp, monocyte-ADCC was enhanced with maximal cytotoxicity at day 14

	386712, irect effects of Corynebacterium parvum and BCG on human monocyte-mediated tumour cell cytostasis in vitro.Four strains of Corynebacterium parvum (Cp) and BCG induced low levels of cytostatic ability to a human tumour cell line in human monocytes when added directly to conventional monocyte cultures. The cytostatic ability induced by mediators from autologous lymphocytes stimulated with the same agents was greater than that produced by direct addition to monocytes. BCG was more efficient in stimulating lymphocyte DNA-synthesis and lymphokine release than any of the Cp strains tested. In order to test the influence of contaminating adherent lymphocytes on the direct induction of cytostasis, monocyte cultures of greater than 99.9% purity were prepared by adherence purification. Cp induced low levels of cytostatic ability in such highly purified monocytes when added directly to the monocytes. Addition of BCG and Candida albicans had an adverse effect on the cytostatic ability of purified monocytes. A morphological study of Cp interaction with purified monocytes was performed. Cp, but not BCG, would seem to be able to induce low levels of cytostatic ability in human monocytes without lympohcyte cooperation. Human monocyte activation by the more effective lymphokine pathway is more efficiently triggered in vitro by BCG than by Cp

	6235074, aradoxical presence of T cell anergy during successful T cell-dependent tumour immunotherapy: characterization of a state of T cell 'amnaesia' following systemic administration of C. parvum.Systemic administration of Corynebacterium parvum causes T cell-dependent regression of an established methylcholanthrene-induced murine fibrosarcoma beginning 10 days after Cp injection. At this time, tumour specific effector T cell responses measured by reactivity in a T helper cell assay or in a Winn assay disappear only to return later. We refer to this temporary lapse in T cell reactivity as immunological 'amnaesia'. Antigen specific T cell responses within all lymphoid organs appear to be affected. The 'amnaesic' state is characterised by the presence of primed T cells but the absence of T effector cells and suppressor cells. The differentiation of the primed T cells is blocked probably as a result on the non-delivery of a differentiation signal. There are several possible mechanisms which could account for this; the one we prefer is that cells are prevented from entering T cell-dependent cell interaction areas within lymphoid organs. This state of T cell 'amnaesia' may underlie anergy in some inflammatory, infectious and neoplastic diseases. The apparent paradox of T cell-dependent tumour regression occurring in mice with depressed T cell responses is discussed

	6624533, ffects of the removal of the primary tumor and immunotherapy with Corynebacterium parvum on metastatic tumor proliferation.The effects of surgical intervention by removal of the primary focus, and the effectiveness of an immunomodulator, Corynebacterium parvum (Cp), on the proliferation of metastatic tumor tissue were investigated by following the postoperative changes in the 3H-thymidine labelling rate of metastatic tissue in an experimental model of metastasis in mice. In addition, the delayed type hypersensitivity reaction (DTH) was studied to investigate the immune capacity of the host. The labelling rate of mice that had the primary focus removed remained high with little variation, while that of the mice not operated on decreased gradually. On the other hand, in mice undergoing a sham operation, the rate was the same as that of the mice with the primary focus removed for a short while, but then gradually decreased. When Cp was administered, especially before removal of the primary focus, the rate was lower than that of the tumor bearing control group and decreased steadily. The number of pulmonary metastatic nodules was increased by removal of the primary focus, but this increase was inhibited by the administration of Cp which prolonged life. The depression in the DTH was less in the group given Cp preoperativeLy than in either the group of mice having the primary focus removed or those not having it removed

	6676630, The effects of surgical intervention and removal of the primary tumor, and the effectiveness of Corynebacterium parvum on metastatic tumor proliferation]The effects of surgical intervention and removal of the primary tumor, and the effectiveness of Corynebacterium parvum (Cp) on the proliferation of metastatic tumor tissue were investigated by using autoradiography to follow post-operative changes in the 3H-thymidine labelling rate of metastatic tissue in an experimental model of metastasis in mice. In addition, the delayed hypersensitivity reaction and the cytotoxicity (ADCC, NK) of lung cells were studied, to investigate the immune capacity of the host. The effect of surgical intervention on the proliferation of metastatic tumor tissue was only transitory, while removal of the primary tumor caused the continuous proliferation of remnant foci. This indicated that the primary tumor controlled the metastatic proliferation. C. parvum is an effective immunomodulator ; hence, when given before removal of the primary focus, it inhibited the formation and the continuing proliferation of remnant metastatic foci, and maintained the immune capacity of the host

	7446129, tructure and function of human effusion macrophages from patients with malignant and benign disease. 2. In vitro cytostatic and cytolytic effect on human tumour cell lines.Human effusion macrophages isolated from the pleural or ascitic effusions of 14 patients with malignant or benign disease usually inhibited methyl-3H-thymidine incorporation in an adherent human tumour cell line (NHIK 3025) when the macrophages were challenged with target cells immediately after isolation. The cytostatic activity disappeared when the macrophages were cultured for 18 hours in vitro before target cell challenge. The presence of endotoxin (LPS) or Corynebacterium parvum (Cp) during the macrophage-target cell interaction induced a small enhancement of the macrophage-mediated cytostatic activity. Preincubation of macrophages with Cp or Cp-induced lymphokine supernatants for 2-18 hours before target cell challenge induced increased cytostatic activity in the macrophage cultures. Adherent (NHIK 3025) or non-adherent (K-562) human tumour cells prelabelled with methyl-3H-thymidine, when added to freshly isolated macrophages, were lysed in a slowly progressive manner. The cytolytic activity to K-562 cells was enhanced by increasing macrophage density in the cultures, and by incubating the macrophages for 2 hours with lymphokine supernatants before target cell challenge. Morphological observations indicated that K-562 cells adhered to macrophage membranes, with lysis proceeding extracellularily

	8206513, nduced hyporesponsiveness in rat Kupffer cells is not specific for lipopolysaccharide.The phenomenon of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced hyporesponsiveness has been reported to occur in macrophage cell lines and primary cells. Hyporesponsiveness was evidenced by a diminution or lack of production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) after sequential doses of LPS. In order to characterize the hyporesponsive state in Kupffer cells, the production of TNF-alpha was quantified after varying the concentration of a primary low dose of LPS prior to a challenge with a high, normally stimulatory dose of LPS. The kinetics of establishment of the hyporesponsive state and the effect of varying the bacterial serotype and genus of the challenge dose were determined. The specificity of the hyporesponsive state for LPS was examined. Our results demonstrate that complete hyporesponsiveness with no detectable production of TNF-alpha (&lt; 30 pg/ml) was achieved after a primary dose &gt; or = 10 ng/ml. Establishment of the hyporesponsive state took place within 6 hr. Induction of hyporesponsiveness was not dependent upon the serotype or genus of the challenge dose of LPS and was not specific for LPS. Complete hyporesponsiveness was induced after a primary dose (10 micrograms/ml) of the Gram-positive bacterium Corynebacterium parvum (Cp) and was evident upon challenge with 100 micrograms/ml Cp. The data indicate that the mechanisms by which LPS and Cp induce hyporesponsiveness are not identical in that a primary dose of LPS (10 ng/ml) induced only partial hyporesponsiveness upon challenge with Cp (100 micrograms/ml). These studies improve our understanding of Kupffer cell function

	897175, ombined radiotherapy and Corynebacterium parvum treatment of a murine fibrosarcoma.A single dose of Corynebacterium parvum (Cp) at 70 microgram, 175 microgram or 350 microgram was effective in suppressing the growth of a subcutaneous fibrosarcoma and occasionally in inducing complete regression and in prolonging the survival time of C3H/HeJ tumor-bearing mice. A single exposure of x rays at 2,000 rads induced some complete regression, but a higher number of complete regressions was induced by combined x-ray and Cp treatment. In the combined x-ray and Cp treatment, Cp given on the same day immediately after x irradiation was best. When 70 microgram of Cp was given a few days before x rays, the intravenous and intraperitoneal routes were better than the intratumor route of injection

D. ananassae, however, harbors a single homolog of these genes. Like other Adh-derived chimeric genes, siren evolved adaptively shortly after it was formed. These changes likely shifted the catalytic activity of siren

	18802746, issue expression pattern of class II and class V genes found in the Adh complex on mouse chromosome 3.The alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes in mice and humans are encoded by a linked group of genes in the same transcriptional orientation. The enzymes play important roles in alcohol metabolism and retinoid signaling and homeostasis. The expression patterns at the mRNA level of the mouse Adh4 (class II) gene and the recently identified Adh6a and Adh6b genes (class V) are now reported to complete this analysis for the entire family. Adh4 is expressed at high levels in liver and is detectable in small intestine and testes. Adh6b is expressed in liver but Adh6a is not. Adh6a is expressed at high levels in small intestine while Adh6b is not. Adh6a expression is detectable in the female adrenal and not at all in the male adrenal, but Adh6b is expressed at moderate levels in both sexes. Although Adh6a and Adh6b have expression patterns different from each other, neither expresses like any other gene in the complex, suggesting different control mechanisms and possibly different functions

	19033156, irect evidence that genetic variation in glycerol-3-phosphate and malate dehydrogenase genes (Gpdh and Mdh1) affects adult ethanol tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster.Many studies of alcohol adaptation in Drosophila melanogaster have focused on the Adh polymorphism, yet the metabolic elimination of alcohol should involve many enzymes and pathways. Here we evaluate the effects of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gpdh) and cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (Mdh1) genotype activity on adult tolerance to ethanol. We have created a set of P-element-excision-derived Gpdh, Mdh1, and Adh alleles that generate a range of activity phenotypes from full to zero activity. Comparisons of paired Gpdh genotypes possessing 10 and 60% normal activity and 66 and 100% normal activity show significant effects where higher activity increases tolerance. Mdh1 null allele homozygotes show reductions in tolerance. We use piggyBac FLP-FRT site-specific recombination to create deletions and duplications of Gpdh. Duplications show an increase of 50% in activity and an increase of adult tolerance to ethanol exposure. These studies show that the molecular polymorphism associated with GPDH activity could be maintained in natural populations by selection related to adaptation to alcohols. Finally, we examine the interactions between activity genotypes for Gpdh, Mdh1, and Adh. We find no significant interlocus interactions. Observations on Mdh1 in both Gpdh and Adh backgrounds demonstrate significant increases in ethanol tolerance with partial reductions (50%) in cytosolic MDH activity. This observation strongly suggests the operation of pyruvate-malate and, in particular, pyruvate-citrate cycling in adaptation to alcohol exposure. We propose that an understanding of the evolution of tolerance to alcohols will require a system-level approach, rather than a focus on single enzymes

	19154371, exual selection accelerates the elimination of a deleterious mutant in Drosophila melanogaster.Although theory indicates that indirect genetic benefits through mate choice should be widespread, empirical work has often either failed to detect the operation of such benefits or shown a net cost to the presence of sexual selection. We tested whether sexual selection can increase the speed with which a conditionally deleterious allele is removed from a laboratory population of Drosophila melanogaster. The alcohol dehydrogenase null allele (Adh-) confers slightly lower viability than wild-type alleles in the absence of ethanol but is lethal in homozygotes when ethanol comprises 6% of the medium. We tracked the frequency of this allele in artificially constructed populations reared at three different levels of ethanol (0%, 2%, and 4%) that either experienced sexual selection or did not. Loss of the deleterious Adh- allele was more rapid when sexual selection was allowed to act, especially in the presence of ethanol. We also quantified the strength of both nonsexual and sexual selection against the Adh- allele using maximum-likelihood estimation. In contrast to recent experiments employing monogamy/polygamy designs, our results demonstrate a fitness benefit to sexual selection. This is consistent with the operation of good-genes female choice

	19160843, Breeding of Actinobacillus succiniogenes mutants with improved succinate production based on metabolic flux analysis]It is very important to obtain high yield mutant strains on the base of metabolic flux analysis of Actinobacillus succinogenes S.JST for the industrial bioconversion of succinic acid. The metabolic pathway was analized at first and the flux of the metabolic networks was calculated by matrix. In order to decrease acetic acid flux, the strains mutated by soft X-ray of synchronous radiation were screened on the plates with high concentration of fluoroacetic acid. For decreasing the metabolic flux of ethanol the site-directed mutagenesis was carried out for the reduction of alcohol dehydrogenase(Adh) specific activity. Then the enzyme activity determination and the gene sequence analysis of the mutant strain was compared with those of the parent strain. Metabolic flux analysis of the parent strain indicated that the flux of succinic acid was 1.78(mmol/g/h) and that the flux of acetic acid and ethanol were 0.60 (mmol/g/h) and 1.04( mmol/g/h), respectively. Meanwhile the metabolic pathway analysis showed that the ethanol metabolism enhanced the lacking of H electron donor during the synthesis of succinic acid and that the succinic acid flux was weakened by the metabolism of byproducts ethanol and acetic acid. Compared with the parent strain, the acetic acid flux of anti-fluoroacetic mutant strain S.JST1 was 0.024 (mmol/g/h), decreasing by 96%. Then the enzyme determination showed that the specific activity unit of phosphotransacetylase(Pta) decreased from 602 to 74 and a mutated site was founded in the pta gene of the mutant strain S.JST1. Compared with that of the parent strain S.JST1 the ethanol flux of adh-site-directed mutant strain S.JST2 was 0.020 (mmol/g/h), decreasing by 98%. Then the enzyme determination showed that the specific activity unit of Adh decreased from 585 to 62 and the yield of end product succinic acid was 65.7 (g/L). The interdiction of Adh and Pta decreased the metabolism of byproducts and the H electron donor was well balanced, thus the succinic acid flux was strengthened by the redundant carbon flux from these byproducts. The mutant strain S.JST2 obtained in this paper deserves being extended to application of industrial fermentation

	19232490,  novel assay for rapid in vivo determination of phenotypic stability of recombinant ethanol-producing microorganisms.A rapid empirical assay is presented for assessing the phenotypic stability of continuous cultures of recombinant bacteria containing transposed pdc and adh genes for ethanol production. The method measures spectrophotometrically the rate of colour formation when cells oxidize added ethanol to acetaldehyde in the presence of Schiff's reagent. During chemostat cultures of the recombinant ethanologen Escherichia coli KO11 on 20 g/l glucose, assay activities were stable and high at ca 8 x 10(-4) DeltaOD(540)/(s.OD(550)), reflecting the high, stable ethanol yield (ca 95%). On 20 g/l and 50 g/l xylose, ethanol yields declined rapidly to about 60% and this was closely mirrored by the assay activities which fell to ca 1.5 DeltaOD(540)/(s.OD(550)), only slightly higher than those measured for the parent strain. Typically taking only about an hour to perform, the assay provides a faster means of gauging the phenotypic stability of ethanol production than is possible by conventional methods

	19401227, ptimization of metabolic pathways for bioconversion of lignocellulose to ethanol through genetic engineering.The optimization of metabolic pathways is of fundamental importance for strategies aimed at improving the economics and yield of the lignocellulose-to-ethanol processes. Although Escherichia coli is capable of metabolizing a wide variety of substrates including hexoses and pentoses, its hexose metabolism is inferior to that of Zymomonas mobilis, an obligate, ethanologenic bacterium. We therefore inserted and expressed Z. mobilis genes encoding essential enzymes involved in the fermentation pathway, alcohol dehydrogenase II (adh II) and pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc), into E. coli, resulting in increased cell growth and ethanol production. Ethanol concentrations of &gt;30 g/L were obtained on 10% glucose. Additionally, since pyruvate is mainly assimilated through pyruvate formate lyase (pfl) and forms formic acid and acetyl coenzyme A, metabolic redirection was attempted through gene knockout by Red-mediated recombination to decrease the byproducts of pyruvate metabolism. Under microaerobic conditions, pflA- and pflB-mutants produced more ethanol (163% and 207%, respectively) relative to the parent strain, using glucose as a carbon source

	19902949, inding the joker among the maize endogenous reference genes for genetically modified organism (GMO) detection.The comparison of five real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods targeted at maize ( Zea mays ) endogenous sequences is reported. PCR targets were the alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) gene for three methods and high-mobility group (hmg) gene for the other two. The five real-time PCR methods have been checked under repeatability conditions at several dilution levels on both pooled DNA template from several genetically modified (GM) maize certified reference materials (CRMs) and single CRM DNA extracts. Slopes and R(2) coefficients of all of the curves obtained from the adopted regression model were compared within the same method and among all of the five methods, and the limit of detection and limit of quantitation were analyzed for each PCR system. Furthermore, method equivalency was evaluated on the basis of the ability to estimate the target haploid genome copy number at each concentration level. Results indicated that, among the five methods tested, one of the hmg-targeted PCR systems can be considered equivalent to the others but shows the best regression parameters and a higher repeteability along the dilution range. Thereby, it is proposed as a valid module to be coupled to different event-specific real-time PCR for maize genetically modified organism (GMO) quantitation. The resulting practicability improvement on the analytical control of GMOs is discussed

	20141418, ikopleura dioica alcohol dehydrogenase class 3 provides new insights into the evolution of retinoic acid synthesis in chordates.Enzymes that synthesize retinoic acid (RA) constitute the first level of regulation of RA action. In vertebrates, enzymes of the medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenase (MDR-Adh) family catalyze the first step of the RA synthetic pathway by oxidizing retinol. Among MDR-Adh enzymes, Adh3 is the only member present in non-vertebrates, and whether Adh3 is actually involved in RA biosynthesis remains uncertain. Here, we investigate the MDR-Adh family in Oikopleura dioica, a urochordate representing the sister group to vertebrates. Oikopleura is of special interest because it has lost the classical RA role in development, which relaxed evolutionary constraints to preserve the RA-genetic machinery, leading to the loss of RA-system components. The hypothesis that Adh3 plays a role in RA synthesis predicts that the relaxation of selection in Oikopleura should have led to the loss of Adh3, or changes in residues related to retinol oxidation. The hypothesis also predicts changes in the expression pattern of Oikopleura Adh3 compared to other chordates that preserved RA-signaling. Our results, however, revealed the presence of a highly conserved Adh3 gene in Oikopleura, with no significant changes in functional residues. Our results also revealed that the Oikopleura Adh3 expression remains unchanged in comparison to other non-vertebrate chordates, restricted to specific compartments of the digestive system. Because Adh3 has been highly conserved in an animal that has dismantled the RA system, we conclude that Adh3 preservation is not due to a conserved role in RA synthesis. Thereby, if Adh3 plays a role in RA synthesis in vertebrates, it might be a lineage-specific neofunctionalization

	18214689, he epigenetics of mantle cell lymphoma.There is no consensus treatment for newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma. The CHOP + rituximab and hyperCVAD + rituximab regimens are most commonly used. The former is limited by relatively lower rates of complete remission (CR) and frequent relapses. The latter is limited by toxicities, especially in older patients, and relapses that occur later than those usually seen with CHOP + rituximab. Thus, improved therapies are needed. The purine analog cladribine (2-cda) + rituximab has been studied as an alternative frontline regimen in MCL and is quite active with minimal toxicity. Cladribine has epigenetic activity in that it inhibits DNA methylation. Cladribine + rituximab should be further studied in newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma in combination with new agents such as inhibitors of histone deacetylation, the mTOR pathway, and the proteasome

	10404094, enomic instability and alterations in Apc, Mcc and Dcc in Hong Kong patients with colorectal carcinoma.Our aim was to reveal the significance of tumor-suppressor genes and genomic instability in 99 Hong Kong Chinese colorectal carcinoma (CRC) patients by PCR-LOH analysis and PCR-PTT assay. The frequencies of allelic loss of Apc, Mcc and Dcc and of APC truncation were 31.3% (15/48), 11.6% (5/43), 44.4% (20/45) and 46/93 (49.5%), respectively. The frequency of Apc LOH was similar to, the Mcc LOH was lower than, and the Dcc LOH was higher than that reported for Caucasians and Japanese. In Hong Kong CRC patients, the replication error-positive (RER(+)) phenotype occurred with a frequency of 10% (10/99), which was similar to other results using microsatellite markers where RER(+) frequencies ranged from 11% to 28%. The rates of genetic alteration in RER(+) tumors were lower in tumors harboring p53, Mcc and Dcc alterations; similar in Apc; and higher in Ki-ras tumors compared with RER(-) tumors, though these differences did not achieve statistical significance. None of the biomarkers examined were predictive of survival independently, but strong trends confirming earlier observations of associations between RER(+) phenotypes with proximal tumor location and poorly differentiated tumor status were noted. The RER(+) phenotype was correlated significantly to the less aggressive Duke's stage B and improved prognosis. Additionally, tumors with RER(+) phenotypes were positively correlated with young age and sex. Our results support the observation that a subset of younger male CRC patients in Hong Kong may develop CRC via the RER pathway and show differences in RER status and sex. A significantly higher percentage of older Hong Kong Chinese CRC patients had APC truncations. Int. J. Cancer (Pred. Oncol.) 84:404-409, 1999

	9473770, ecreased expression of the adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) and mutated in colorectal cancer (Mcc) genes in mouse lung neoplasia.A decrease in the intracellular concentrations of the transcripts for some tumor suppressor genes has been found during murine lung tumorigenesis; for p15INK4b and p16INK4a, this was due to homozygous deletions. We report here a decrease in the mRNA levels of the mutated in colorectal cancer (Mcc) and adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) genes in mouse lung tumors and some neoplastic cell lines. This was assessed both by northern blotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of RNA isolated from lung tumors that had been induced by urethane, N-nitrosodiethylamine, or 3-methylcholanthrene in (A/J x C57BL/6) F1 or A/J mice. A reduced amount of both Mcc and Apc messages was also seen when two neoplastic cell lines, a spontaneous transformant (E9) and a line derived from a chemically induced solid tumor (82-132), were compared with two independently derived nontumorigenic cell lines (E10 and C10); E9 was derived from E10, and all of these lines are probably of alveolar type 2 cell origin. A cell line derived from a chemically induced papillary lung tumor probably of bronchiolar Clara cell origin (LM2) had Mcc mRNA levels similar to those of C10 and E10 but reduced Apc mRNA levels. A line (p53-823) derived from a papillary tumor that arose in a mouse with a mutated p53 transgene had a reduced amount of the Mcc gene product only. These differential changes in the relative amounts of Apc and Mcc messages in LM2 and p53-823) cells may serve as useful models for studying the regulation of their expression. Both messages had half-lives of 6-9 h in normal E10 and neoplastic E9 cells, so decreased message stability does not account for these reductions. This is the first report of estimated degradation rates of these mRNAs. Apc and Mcc message content did not vary as a function of growth status of the cell lines. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis did not reveal mutations in Apc coding regions known to have a high mutation frequency in human colon tumors. Loss of heterozygosity of Apc and Mcc was not found in tumors that developed in the F1 mice, implying a lack of allelic deletions. These changes in tumor suppressor gene expression may contribute to the development and maintenance of neoplasia in lung epithelium

	18070874,  49-kDa mini-lipoxygenase from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 retains catalytically complete functionality.Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 is one of the few prokaryotes harboring a lipoxygenase (LOX) gene. The sequence resides in an open reading frame encoding a fusion protein of a catalase-like hemoprotein with an unusually short LOX (approximately 49 kDa) at the C terminus. The recombinant mini-LOX contains a non-heme iron in the active site and is highly active with linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids (which occur naturally in Anabaena) giving the respective 9R-hydroperoxides, the mirror image of the 9S-LOX products of plants. Using stereospecifically labeled [11-(3)H]linoleic acids we show that reaction is catalyzed via a typical antarafacial relationship of initial hydrogen abstraction and oxygenation. The mini-LOX oxygenated C16/C18:2-phosphatidylcholine with 9R specificity, suggesting a  tail first  mode of fatty acid binding. Site-directed mutagenesis of an active site Ala (Ala215), typically conserved as Gly in R-LOX, revealed that substitution with Gly retained 9R specificity, whereas the larger Val substitution switched oxygenation to 13S, implying that Ala215 represents the functional equivalent of the Gly in other R-LOX. Metabolism studies using a synthetic fatty acid with extended double bond conjugation, 9E,11Z,14Z-20:3omega6, showed that the mini-LOX can control oxygenation two positions further along the fatty acid carbon chain. We conclude that the mini-LOX, despite lacking the beta-barrel domain and much additional sequence, is catalytically complete. Interestingly, animal and plant LOX, which undoubtedly share a common ancestor, are related in sequence only in the catalytic domain; it is possible that the prokaryotic LOX represents a common link and that the beta-barrel domain was then acquired independently in the animal and plant kingdoms

	19088442,  highly conserved alanine in the S6 domain of the hERG1 K+ channel is required for normal gating.The central cavity of K(+)-selective ion channels is lined by four S6 transmembrane alpha-helices. An Ala residue is located near the midpoint of each S6 and marks the narrowest point of the central cavity. In hERG1 channels, we determined the functional consequences of substituting this conserved Ala (Ala653) with other hydrophobic or charged amino acids. Mutant channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and ionic currents measured by using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique. Substitution of Ala653 with bulkier hydrophobic residues (Val, Leu, Ile, Met, Phe, Trp) did not prevent ion conduction, but the mutant channels activated at more negative potentials compared to wild-type channels. The half-point for voltage dependent activation was shifted by -54 mV for the most conservative hydrophobic mutation, A653V. Oxidation of A653C hERG1 channels induced a maintained current at negative membrane potentials. This effect was not reversible with dithiothreitol, indicating that the sulfhydryl side-chains of Cys653 were oxidized to a negatively charged sulfinic or sulfonic acid. Substitution of Ala653 with acidic (Asp, Glu) or basic (Arg, Lys) residues prevented channel deactivation. Thus, an Ala at position 653 in hERG1 is required for normal voltage dependence of channel gating and a charged residue in this position prevents channel closure

	19090571, nfluence of ionization on the conformational preferences of peptide models. Ramachandran surfaces of N-formyl-glycine amide and N-formyl-alanine amide radical cations.Ramachandran maps of neutral and ionized HCO-Gly-NH2 and HCO-Ala-NH2 peptide models have been built at the B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) level of calculation. Direct optimizations using B3LYP and the recently developed MPWB1K functional have also been carried out, as well as single-point calculations at the CCSD(T) level of theory with the 6-311++G(2df,2p) basis set. Results indicate that for both peptide models ionization can cause drastic changes in the shape of the PES in such a way that highly disallowed regions in neutral PES become low-energy regions in the radical cation surface. The structures localized in such regions, epsilonL+* and epsilonD+* are highly stabilized due to the formation of 2-centre-3-electron interactions between the two carbonyl oxygens. Inclusion of solvent effects by the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) shows that the solute-solvent interaction energy plays an important role in determining the stability order

	19113858, ompetition between reversible aggregation and loop formation in denatured iso-1-cytochrome c.The competition between intramolecular histidine-heme loop formation and ligand-mediated oligomer formation in the denatured state is investigated for two yeast iso-1-cytochrome c variants, AcH26I52 and AcA25H26I52. Besides the native His 18 heme ligand, both variants contain a single His at position 26. The AcA25H26I52 variant has Pro 25 mutated to Ala. The concentration dependence of the apparent pK(a) for His 26-heme binding in 3 M guanidine hydrochloride indicates that the P25A mutation disfavors oligomerization mediated by intermolecular heme ligation by 10-fold. Single- and double-pH-jump stopped-flow experiments with the AcH26I52 variant show that fast phases for His-heme bond formation and breakage are due to intramolecular loop formation and slow phases for His-heme bond formation and breakage are due to intermolecular aggregation. The presence of two closely spaced slow phases in the kinetics of loop formation for both variants suggests that intermolecular His 26-heme ligation results in both dimers and higher-order aggregates. The P25A mutation slows formation and speeds breakdown of an initial dimer, demonstrating a strong effect of local sequence on aggregation. Analysis of the kinetic data yields equilibrium constants for intramolecular loop formation and intermolecular dimerization at pH 7.1 and indicates that the rate constant for intermolecular aggregation is very fast at this pH (10(7)-10(8) M(-1) s(-1)). In light of the very fast rates of aggregation in the denatured state, comparison of models involving reversible or irreversible oligomerization steps suggests that equilibrium control of the partitioning between folding and aggregation is advantageous for productive protein folding in vivo

	19128968, ancomycin resistance: modeling backbone variants with D-Ala-D-Ala and D-Ala-D-Lac peptides.To seek vancomycin analogs with broader antibacterial activity, effects of backbone modifications for the agylcon 2 on binding with D-Ala-D-Ala- and D-Ala-D-Lac-containing peptides were investigated by Monte Carlo/free energy perturbation (MC/FEP) calculations. The experimental trend in binding affinities for 2 with three tripeptides was well reproduced. Possible modifications of the peptide bond between residues 4 and 5 were then considered, specifically for conversion of the OCNH linkage to CH(2)NH(2)(+) (6), FCCH (7), HCCH (8), and HNCO (9). The MC/FEP results did not yield binding improvements for 7, 8, and 9, though the fluorovinyl replacement is relatively benign. The previously reported analog 6 remains as the only variant that exhibits improved affinity for the D-Ala-D-Lac sequence and acceptable affinity for the D-Ala-D-Ala sequence

	19137603, onformational preferences of a short Aib/Ala-based water-soluble peptide as a function of temperature.The amino acid Aib predisposes a peptide to be helical with context-dependent preference for either 3(10)- or alpha- or a mixed helical conformation. Short peptides also show an inherent tendency to be unfolded. To characterize helical and unfolded states adopted by water-soluble Aib-containing peptides, the conformational preference of Ac-Ala-Aib-Ala-Lys-Ala-Aib-Lys-Ala-Lys-Ala-Aib-Tyr-NH(2) was determined by CD, NMR and MD simulations as a function of temperature. Temperature-dependent CD data indicated the contribution of two major components, each an admixture of helical and extended/polyproline II structures. Both right- and left-handed helical conformations were detected from deconvolution of CD data and (13)C NMR experiments. The presence of a helical backbone, more pronounced at the N-terminal, and a temperature-induced shift in alpha-helix/3(10)-helix equilibrium, more pronounced at the C-terminal, emerged from NMR data. Starting from polyproline II, the N-terminal of the peptide folded into a helical backbone in MD simulations within 5 ns at 60 degrees C. Longer simulations showed a mixed-helical backbone to be stable over the entire peptide at 5 degrees C while at 60 degrees C the mixed-helix was either stable at the N-terminus or occurred in short stretches through out the peptide, along with a significant population of polyproline II. Our results point towards conformational heterogeneity of water-soluble Aib-based peptide helices and the associated subtleties. The problem of analyzing CD and NMR data of both left- and right-handed helices are discussed, especially the validity of the ellipticity ratio [theta](222)/[theta](207), as a reporter of alpha-/3(10)- population ratio, in right- and left-handed helical mixtures

	19151092, minoacyl-tRNA recognition by the FemXWv transferase for bacterial cell wall synthesis.Transferases of the Fem family catalyse peptide-bond formation by using aminoacyl-tRNAs and peptidoglycan precursors as donor and acceptor substrates, respectively. The specificity of Fem transferases is essential since mis-incorporated amino acids could act as chain terminators thereby preventing formation of a functional stress-bearing peptidoglycan network. Here we have developed chemical acylation of RNA helices with natural and non-proteinogenic amino acids to gain insight into the specificity of the model transferase FemX(Wv). Combining modifications in the RNA and aminoacyl moieties of the donor substrate revealed that unfavourable interactions of FemX(Wv) with the acceptor arm of tRNA(Gly) and with L-Ser or larger residues quantitatively accounts for the preferential transfer of L-Ala observed with complete aminoacyl-tRNAs. The main FemX(Wv) identity determinant was identified as the penultimate base pair (G(2)-C(71)) of the acceptor arm instead of G(3)*U(70) for the alanyl-tRNA synthetase. FemX(Wv) tolerated a configuration inversion of the Calpha of L-Ala but not the introduction of a second methyl on this atom. These results indicate that aminoacyl-tRNA recognition by FemX(Wv) is distinct from other components of the translation machinery and relies on the exclusion of bulky amino acids and of the sequence of tRNA(Gly) from the active site

	19165720, n approach to characterizing single-subunit mutations in multimeric prepores and pores of anthrax protective antigen.Heptameric pores formed by the protective antigen (PA) moiety of anthrax toxin translocate the intracellular effector moieties of the toxin across the endosomal membrane to the cytosol of mammalian cells. We devised a protocol to characterize the effects of individual mutations in a single subunit of heptameric PA prepores (pore precursors) or pores. We prepared monomeric PA containing a test mutation plus an innocuous Cys-replacement mutation at a second residue (Lys563, located on the external surface of the prepore). The introduced Cys was biotinylated, and the protein was allowed to cooligomerize with a 20-fold excess of wild-type PA. Finally, biotinylated prepores were freed from wild-type prepores by avidin affinity chromatography. For the proof of principle, we examined single-subunit mutations of Asp425 and Phe427, two residues where Ala replacements have been shown to cause strong inhibitory effects. The single-subunit D425A mutation inhibited pore formation by &gt;10(4) and abrogated activity of PA almost completely in our standard cytotoxicity assay. The single-subunit F427A mutation caused approximately 100-fold inhibition in the cytotoxicity assay, and this effect was shown to result from a combination of strong inhibition of translocation and smaller effects on pore formation and ligand affinity. Our results show definitively that replacing a single residue in one subunit of the heptameric PA prepore can inhibit the transport activity of the oligomer almost completely-and by different mechanisms, depending on the specific residue mutated

	19177909, dentification and determination of the intra- and extracellular aminopeptidase activity by synthetic L-Ala-, L-Tyr-, and L-Phe-beta-napthylamide.A simple, rapid and straightforward procedure for identification and determination of intracellular and extracellular activity of aminopeptidases employing synthetic substrates beta-naphtylamides of L-Ala, L-Phe, and L-Tyr was used. Poppy cells (Papaver somniferum L.) permeabilized by Tween 80 were immobilized via crosslinking by glutaraldehyde. Glutaraldehyde immobilized poppy cells lost their viability and demonstrated significantly lower aminopeptidase activities than untreated control cells probably due to a damage to the enzyme active centre. Poppy cells immobilized by pectate and alginate have retained high activity of studied aminopeptidases. The culture medium (without cells) used for the identification and determination of extracellular enzyme activities retained 20-21%, whereas intracellular activities were estimated to be 79-80% of total enzyme activity. Thus the intracellular specific activity was 1.00-1.07 higher

	19185508, b initio investigation of the hydration of deprotonated amino acids.The complexation of five deprotonated anionic amino acids (glycine, L-alanine, L-valine, L-Aspartic acid, and L-glutamine) with one water molecule, has been investigated using a MP2/63-11++G(d,p) approach fully accounting for the basis set superposition errors. For each amino acid, several energetic minima have been identified, and we provide spectroscopic information allowing to discriminate them. Our results strongly suggest that two complexes should coexist under the experimental conditions for [Ala - H](-), [Val - H](-), and [Asp - H](-). Comparisons with the experimental enthalpies, entropies, and Gibbs free energies recently obtained by Wincel [J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2008, 19, 1091-1097] show that our simulation reproduces the most significant structure/energy experimental trends, though the entropic changes induced by hydration are slightly overestimated

	19193005, enetic incorporation of a metal-ion chelating amino acid into proteins as a biophysical probe.A metal-ion chelating amino acid, (8-hydroxyquinolin-3-yl)alanine, was genetically encoded in E. coli by an amber nonsense codon and corresponding orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair. The amino acid was incorporated into TM0665 protein, and the mutant protein was cocrystallized with Zn(2+) to determine the structure by SAD phasing. The structure showed a high occupancy of the heavy metal bound to the HQ-Ala residue, and the heavy metal provided excellent phasing power to determine the structure. This method also facilitates the de novo design of metalloproteins with novel structures and functions, including fluorescent sensors

	19195660, eversed-phase high performance liquid chromatographic separation of diastereomers of beta-amino alcohols and microwave assisted synthesis of Marfey's reagent, its chiral variants and diastereomers.Ten chiral derivatizing reagents (CDRs) were synthesized by replacing the L-Ala-NH(2) moiety in Marfey's reagent (MR) by seven L-amino acid amides and three L-amino acids employing microwave irradiation (MW) and were characterized. Ten racemic amino alcohols were derivatized with these CDRs under MW. The diastereomers were separated on a reversed-phase C(18) column using binary mixtures of acetonitrile with aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and triethylammonium phosphate buffer (TEAP). In general, amino acid variants of MR provided better separation of diastereomers in comparison to amino acid amide variants. The method was also found successful for the separation of 20 diastereomers from a mixture

	19228871, PAR gamma variant influences angiographic outcome and 10-year cardiovascular risk in male symptomatic coronary artery disease patients.OBJECTIVE: Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma signaling influences metabolic profiles and the propensity toward inflammation. Small-molecule stimulation of PPARgamma is investigated for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. The common PPARgamma Pro12Ala variant has functional and prognostic consequences. A protective effect of the 12Ala-allele carriership on diabetes and myocardial infarction in healthy populations has been suggested. The relevance of this pathway also needs exploration in patients with manifest vascular disease. We investigated the effects of carriership of the Pro12Ala variant on angiographic and cardiovascular event outcomes in male patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study (REGRESS) cohort was genotyped for the Pro12Ala variant (rs1801282). Ten-year follow-up was derived from nation-wide registries, and risks were estimated using proportional hazards. Quantitative coronary angiography measurements were obtained and relations with genotype estimated using a generalized linear model. RESULTS: Genotypes ascertained (n = 679) comprised 540 (80%) Pro/Pro, 126 (19%) Pro/Ala, and 13 (2%) Ala/Ala subjects. The 12Ala allele was associated with less extensive focal (P = 0.001) and diffuse (P = 0.002) atherosclerosis and lower 10-year cardiovascular risk. Hazard ratios were 0.10 (95% CI 0.01-0.70, P = 0.02) for ischemic heart disease and 0.24 (0.08-0.74, P = 0.013) for vascular death, per each added copy of 12Ala, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Carriers of the 12Ala allele of PPARgamma have less widespread CAD and are considerably protected against 10-year (cardio)vascular morbidity and mortality. These long-term findings in patients with manifest CAD support an important role of PPARgamma in determining vascular risk

	19234729, b initio studies of receptor interactions with AMPA ((S)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolyl) propionic acid) and kainic acid (2S-(2 alpha, 3 beta, 4 beta))-2-carboxy-4-(1-methylethenyl)-3-pyrrolidineacetic acid.The optimum geometries and binding energies of the complexes formed by AMPA and Kainic acid, as well as their anions with tyrosine, proline and some tripeptides are investigated with quantum chemical calculations (HF/6-31G**). It was found that receptors featuring the Tyr-Ala-Pro sequence exhibit stronger binding energies to the substrates than the Tyr-Ser-Pro and Tyr-Ser-Ser. As expected, the anions are more bound than the neutral species. This work can lead to investigations on the effect of AMPA receptors mutations on the brain functions, possibly related to criminal tendencies

	19252313, ontribution of each amino acid residue in polymyxin B(3) to antimicrobial and lipopolysaccharide binding activity.This study on the structure-activity relationship of polymyxin B, a cyclic peptide antibiotic, used sixteen synthetic polymyxin B(3) analogs including alanine scanning analogs to elucidate the contribution of the side chains to antimicrobial activity and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding. Of these analogs, [Ala(5)]-polymyxin B(3) showed greatly reduced antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) with MIC values of 4-16 nmol/ml, suggesting that the Dab (alpha,gamma-diaminobutyric acid) residue at position 5 is the most important residue contributing to bactericidal activity. The antibacterial contribution of Dab when located within the lactam ring (positions 5, 8 and 9) was greater than when located outside the ring (positions 1 and 3). [D-Ala(6)]-, [L-Phe(6)]-, [Ala(7)]-, and [Gly(7)]-polymyxin B(3) analogs retained potent antimicrobial activity, indicating that neither the reduction of hydrophobic character of the D-Phe(6)-Leu(7) region nor the D-configuration at position 6 is indispensable for antimicrobial activity. LPS binding studies showed that decreased hydrophobicity of the lactam ring had little effect, but the N(gamma)-amino function of the Dab residues at position 1, 3, 5, 8 and 9 greatly affected LPS binding, with the contribution of Dab(5) being the most significant

	19263451, hiral induction, memory, and amplification in porphyrin homoaggregates based on electrostatic interactions.Supramolecular chirality in two configurational homoaggregates of anionic meso-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin (TPPS) can be induced by D- and L-alanine in acidic water (see picture). The chirality can be further memorized and enforced through strong electrostatic interactions between TPPS aggregates and achiral poly(allylamine) [PAA].Supramolecular chirality in two configurational homoaggregates of anionic meso-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin (TPPS) can be induced by D- and L-alanine (Ala) in acidic water, respectively. The induced supramolecular chirality can be further memorized and enforced, even after complete removal of Ala or in the presence of excess Ala with the opposite configuration, through strong electrostatic interactions with achiral poly(allylamine) [PAA]. The ionic chiral interactions between TPPS and Ala or PAA are characterized by means of UV/Vis absorption and circular dichroism spectrometry. Fluorescence spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy are used as complementary techniques. On the basis of the comprehensive experimental results, a possible mechanism for chiral induction, memory, and amplification of TPPS homoaggregates by chiral amino acids and achiral PAA is proposed. Thus, we demonstrate a novel strategy to realize chiral memory in supramolecular systems by polyelectrolytes through hierarchical electrostatic self-assembly

	19275891, ASK point mutation regulates protein-protein interactions and NR2b promoter activity.Mutations in the CASK gene result in mental retardation and microcephaly in humans, suggesting an important role for CASK in brain. CASK gene knockout in mice causes neonatal lethality, making further elucidation in mouse models difficult. Because CASK was originally identified as a multidomain adaptor protein, identifying a point mutation interrupting a specific protein interaction would be useful in dissecting its molecular function. Here, a Thr-to-Ala mutation in the rat CASK guanylate kinase (GK) domain was shown to reduce interactions among CASK and Tbr-1 and CINAP, two critical brain proteins. The effect is specific: this mutation does not affect CASK dimerization that occurs via the GK domain. The Tbr-1-CASK-CINAP complex regulates expression of the NMDA receptor subunit 2b (NR2b), and we show that this point mutation also affects NR2b promoter activity. The identification of this mutation may make it possible to further dissect the function of CASK in brain

	19295036, Scaffolds based on collagen and chitosan for post-burn tissue engineering]Porous scaffolds based on collagen and chitosan have been obtained from mixed bio-polymeric solutions and mixture freeze-drying method in the purpose of using them as materials for post-burns tissue regeneration. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Soluble collagen from bovine leather was obtained by acid-base extraction (isoelectric pH = 4.82). Two types of chitosan (CS I, M(w) = 755.900, de-acetylating degree of 79.2% and CS II, M(w) = 309.900, de-acetylating degree of 79.7%), were provided by Vascon Co., Canada. Various compositions were prepared and then structurally and morphologically characterized. In vitro degradation studies were performed in buffered collagenase or chitosan solutions, respectively, and the kinetic data were analysed. Materials effect on the tissue regeneration was tested on heat-induced burns in Wistar rats by covering the damaged tissue with collagen-chitosan scaffolds for a period of 28 days. Materials were changed every 7 days. At the end of the follow-up period skin tissue samples were harvested for histological investigation. RESULTS: By freeze-drying of collagen-chitosan solutions porous scaffolds were obtained with a lamellar morphology and porosity closer to chitosan than to collagen. In vitro degradation tests in simulated body fluid with collagenase revealed a decrease of the degradation rate of the collagen by mixing with chitosan. By using chitosan with lower molecular weight the degradation rate of the materials was decreased too, and the influence of the proportion of chitosan in composition diminished; stronger interactions between polymers hinder the enzyme diffusion to the following amino-acids groups: glycine - leucine (Gly-Leu), glycine - isoleucine (Gly-Ile), alanine-proline-glycine/leucine (-Ala-Pro-Gly-/-Leu-). In vivo tests and histological examination revealed a differentiated repair process of the post-combustion wounds in accordance with the scaffold-type influence. CONCLUSION: Scaffolds based on collagen and chitosan are biocompatible materials with promising results for tissue regeneration of the wounds

	19305403,  sequence element that tunes Escherichia coli tRNA(Ala)(GGC) to ensure accurate decoding.Mutating the rare A32-U38 nucleotide pair at the top of the anticodon loop of Escherichia coli tRNA(Ala)(GGC) to a more common U32-A38 pair results in a tRNA that performs almost normally on cognate codons but is unusually efficient in reading near-cognate codons. Pre-steady state kinetic measurements on E. coli ribosomes show that, unlike the wild-type tRNA(Ala)(GGC), the misreading mutant tRNA(Ala)(GGC) shows rapid GTP hydrolysis and no detectable proofreading on near-cognate codons. Similarly, tRNA(Ala)(GGC) mutated to contain C32-G38, a pair that is found in some bacterial tRNA(Ala)(GGC) sequences, was able to decode only the cognate codons, whereas tRNA(Ala)(GGC) containing a more common C32-A38 pair was able to decode all cognate and near-cognate codons tested. We propose that many of the phylogenetically conserved sequence elements present in each tRNA have evolved to suppress translation of near-cognate codons

	19305404, ases in the anticodon loop of tRNA(Ala)(GGC) prevent misreading.The bases at positions 32 and 38 in the tRNA anticodon loop are known to have a specific conservation depending upon the anticodon triplets. Here we report that evolutionarily conserved pairs of bases at positions 32 and 38 in tRNA(Ala)(GGC) prevent misreading of a near-cognate valine codon, GUC. The tRNA(Ala)(GGC) molecules with the conserved A32-U38 and C32-G38 pairs do not read GUC, whereas those with three representative nonconserved pairs, U32-U38, U32-A38 and C32-A38, direct the misincorporation of alanine at this valine codon into the peptide chain. Overexpression of the nonconserved tRNA(Ala)(GGC) in Escherichia coli is toxic and prevents cell growth. These results suggested that the bases at positions 32 and 38 in tRNA(Ala)(GGC) evolved to preserve the fidelity of the cognate codon reading

	19307172, isruption of D-alanyl esterification of Staphylococcus aureus cell wall teichoic acid by the {beta}-lactam resistance modifier (-)-epicatechin gallate.OBJECTIVES: The naturally occurring polyphenol (-)-epicatechin gallate (ECg) increases oxacillin susceptibility in mecA-containing strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Decreased susceptibility to lysostaphin suggests alterations to the wall teichoic acid (WTA) content of ECg-grown bacteria. Changes in WTA structure in response to ECg were determined. METHODS: Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of purified monomers from S. aureus was used to elucidate WTA structures. Molecular modelling of WTA chains was employed to determine their spatial configuration. RESULTS: ECg-grown methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains BB568 and EMRSA-16 displayed markedly reduced resistance to oxacillin, had thickened cell walls and separated poorly. Growth in ECg-supplemented medium reduced the substitution of the WTA backbone by d-alanine (d-Ala); ratios of N-acetyl glucosamine to d-Ala were reduced from 0.6 and 0.49 (for BB568 and EMRSA-16) to 0.3 and 0.28, respectively. Molecular simulations indicated a decrease in the positive charge of the bacterial wall, confirmed by increased binding of cationized ferritin, and an increase in WTA chain flexibility to a random coil conformation. CONCLUSIONS: Structural elucidation and molecular modelling of WTA indicated that conformational changes associated with reduced d-Ala substitution may contribute to the increased susceptibility of MRSA to beta-lactam antibiotics and account for other elements of the ECg-induced phenotype

	19309763, eversed-phase liquid chromatographic determination of enantiomers of atenolol in rat plasma using derivatization with Marfey's reagent.An HPLC method was established for enantioseparation of (R,S)-atenolol (ATE) and determination of enantiomers in rat plasma. Marfey's reagent (1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl-5-L-alanine amide, FDNP-L-Ala-NH(2), MR) was used as chiral derivatizing reagent with detection of diastereomers at 340 nm. It was shown that the R-isomer eluted before the S-isomer. The method was validated for linearity, repeatability, limits of detection and limit of quantification (LOQ). Recovery of ATE at LOQ was 92.8% for (R)-ATE and 92.6% for (S)-ATE

	19331431, ualitative analysis of collective mode frequency shifts in L-alanine using terahertz spectroscopy.We have observed collective mode frequency shifts in deuterium-substituted L-alanine, three of which have previously only been calculated. Terahertz (THz) absorbance spectra were acquired at room temperature in the spectral range of 66-90 cm(-1), or 2.0-2.7 THz, for L-alanine (L-Ala) and four L-Ala compounds in which hydrogen atoms (atomic mass = 1 amu) were substituted with deuterium atoms (atomic mass = 2 amu): L-Ala-2-d, L-Ala-3,3,3-d(3), L-Ala-2,3,3,3-d(4), and L-Ala-d(7). The absorbance maxima of two L-Ala collective modes in this spectral range were recorded for multiple spectral measurements of each compound, and the magnitude of each collective mode frequency shift due to increased mass of these specific atoms was evaluated for statistical significance. Calculations were performed which predict the THz absorbance frequencies based on the estimated reduced mass of the modes. The shifts in absorbance maxima were correlated with the location(s) of the substituted deuterium atom(s) in the L-alanine molecule, and the atoms contributing to the absorbing delocalized mode in the crystal structure were deduced using statistics described herein. The statistical analyses presented also indicate that the precision of the method allows reproducible frequency shifts as small as 1 cm(-1) or 0.03 THz to be observed and that these shifts are not random error in the measurement

	19362200, nantioselective recognition of alanine in solution with modified gold electrodes using chiral PAMAM dendrimers G4.0.Enantiomeric alanine was covalently grafted onto modified gold electrodes with mercaptopropionic acid and PAMAM dendrimers G4.0 with amine terminal groups. Cyclic voltammetric experiments in the presence of monocarboxylic ferrocene as a probe molecule proved that the alanine (Ala) was immobilized as a monolayer on the gold electrodes. Electron transfer to Ru(NH3)6Cl3 in solutions of different pH was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Changes in solution pH resulted in the variation of the charge state of the terminal group and surface pKa values were estimated on the basis of these results. Because of electrostatic interactions between the positive charged groups on the electrode surface and the Ala, enantioselective recognition was possible. The interaction between enantiomers can be proven with molecular simulation. The electro-oxidation peak current was linearly dependent on Ala concentration over the range 0-10 microM with slopes between 143 and 187 microAcm(-2)/microM. The detection limit (3sigma) was 0.4059 microM for PAMAM G4.0-D(+)Ala-L(-)Ala and 0.4172 microM for PAMAM G4.0-L(-)Ala-D(+)Ala

	19374358, mide I bands of terminally blocked alanine in solutions investigated by infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculation: hydrogen-bonding interactions and solvent effects.Structural aspects of terminally blocked alanine trans-N-acetyl-L-alanyl-trans-N'-methylamide (Ac-Ala-NHMe) in several different solvents were compared by attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The amide I bands between 1600 and 1700 cm(-1) appeared to change depending on media, indicating dissimilar hydrogen-bonding interactions among the peptides and solvent molecules. The minimum energy geometry in the isolated gas phase and aqueous environments were calculated at the B3LYP/6-311++G** theoretical level. In the solid state, Ac-Ala-NHMe is assumed to have an extended beta-stranded structure (C5), whereas it is assumed to have a cyclic structure (C7eq or alphaL) in a nonpolar tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvent. The optimized backbone dihedral angles (Phi, Psi) of Ac-Ala-NHMe plus four explicit water molecules were estimated to be -94 degrees and +133 degrees, respectively, indicating the polyproline II structure (PII). The energy differences between the most stable conformers were predicted to be larger for Ac-Ala-NHMe, which implies that more conformational ensemble structures should coexist for the gas phase than for the aqueous medium with explicit water molecules

	19380484, he active form of human aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) repressor lacks exon 8, and its Pro 185 and Ala 185 variants repress both AHR and hypoxia-inducible factor.The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) repressor (AHRR) inhibits AHR-mediated transcription and has been associated with reproductive dysfunction and tumorigenesis in humans. Previous studies have characterized the repressor function of AHRRs from mice and fish, but the human AHRR ortholog (AHRR(715)) appeared to be nonfunctional in vitro. Here, we report a novel human AHRR cDNA (AHRRDelta8) that lacks exon 8 of AHRR(715). AHRRDelta8 was the predominant AHRR form expressed in human tissues and cell lines. AHRRDelta8 effectively repressed AHR-dependent transactivation, whereas AHRR(715) was much less active. Similarly, AHRRDelta8, but not AHRR(715), formed a complex with AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT). Repression of AHR by AHRRDelta8 was not relieved by overexpression of ARNT or AHR coactivators, suggesting that competition for these cofactors is not the mechanism of repression. AHRRDelta8 interacted weakly with AHR but did not inhibit its nuclear translocation. In a survey of transcription factor specificity, AHRRDelta8 did not repress the nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor or estrogen receptor alpha but did repress hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-dependent signaling. AHRRDelta8-Pro(185) and -Ala(185) variants, which have been linked to human reproductive disorders, both were capable of repressing AHR or HIF. Together, these results identify AHRRDelta8 as the active form of human AHRR and reveal novel aspects of its function and specificity as a repressor

	19393216, lucidation of the disulfide bridge pattern of the recombinant human growth and differentiation factor 5 dimer and the interchain Cys/Ala mutant monomer.Growth and differentiation factor 5 (GDF5) is involved in many developmental processes such as chondrogenesis and joint and bone formation. A recombinant monomeric human GDF5 mutant rGDF5(C84A) is in vitro as potent as the dimeric native form, and clinical investigations of rGDF5(C84A) are in progress. Native homodimeric GDF5 belongs to the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily; each monomer contains a cystine knot formed by three intrachain disulfide bridges, and the monomers are connected via an interchain disulfide bridge. The disulfide bridge pattern of recombinant homodimeric rGDF5 was recently elucidated by X-ray diffraction. A combination of proteolytic degradation with thermolysin, separation of the generated fragments by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and subsequent analyses of the disulfide-linked peptides by electrospray-mass spectrometry and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, amino acid analysis, and Edman degradation led to the unambiguous identification of the disulfide bridge pattern of the monomeric mutant rGDF5(C84A) and of the homodimeric rGDF5 in solution. The cystine knot of homodimeric rGDF5 exhibits the pattern Cys1-Cys5, Cys2-Cys6, and Cys3-Cys7 (three intrachain disulfide bonds), and the monomers are connected by a single interchain disulfide bridge (Cys4-Cys4) in accordance with other members of the TGF-beta superfamily. The monomeric mutant rGDF5(C84A) exhibits the same cystine knot pattern as homodimeric rGDF5

	19423917, u(II)-catalyzed reactions in ternary [Cu(AA)(AA - H)]+ complexes (AA = Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, t-Leu, Phe).The unimolecular chemistry of [Cu(II)AA(AA - H)](+) complexes, composed of an intact and a deprotonated amino acid (AA) ligand, have been probed in the gas phase by tandem and multistage mass spectrometry in an electrospray ionization quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. The amino acids examined include Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, t-Leu and Phe. Upon collisionally-activated dissociation (CAD), the [Cu(II)AA(AA - H)](+) complexes undergo decarboxylation with simultaneous reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I); during this process, a radical site is created at the alpha-carbon of the decarboxylated ligand (H(2)N(1) - (*)C(alpha)H - C(beta)H(2) - R; R = side chain substituent). The radical site is able to move along the backbone of the decarboxylated amino acid to form two new radicals (HN(1)(*) - C(alpha)H(2) - C(beta)H(2) - R and H(2)N(1) - C(alpha)H(2) - (*)C(beta)H - R). From the complexes of Gly and t-Leu, only C(alpha) and N(1) radicals can be formed. The whole radical ligand can be lost to form [Cu(I)AA](+) from these three isomeric radicals. Alternatively, further radical induced dissociations can take place along the backbone of the decarboxylated amino acid ligand to yield [Cu(II)AA(AA - 2H - CO(2))](+), [Cu(I)AA((*)NH(2))](+), [Cu(I)AA(HN = C(alpha)H(2))](+), or [Cu(I)AA(H(2)N - C(alpha)H = C(beta)H - R'](+) (R' = partial side chain substituent). The sodiated copper complexes, [Cu(II)(AA - H + Na)(AA - H)](+), show the same fragmentation patterns as their non-sodiated counterparts; sodium ion is retained on the intact amino acid ligand and is not involved in the CAD pathways. The amino groups of both AA units, the carbonyl group of the intact amino acid, and the deprotonated hydroxyl oxygen coordinate Cu(II) in square-planar fashion. Ab initio calculations indicate that the metal ion facilitates hydrogen atom shuttling between the N(1), C(alpha) and C(beta) atoms of the decarboxylated amino acid ligand. The dissociations of the decarboxylated radical ions unveil important insight about the so far largely unknown intrinsic chemistry of alpha-amino acid and peptide radicals, which are implicated as intermediates in numerous pathogenic biological processes

	19429716, unctional importance of a structurally distinct homodimeric complex of the family B G protein-coupled secretin receptor.Oligomerization of G protein-coupled receptors has been described, but its structural basis and functional importance have been inconsistent. Here, we demonstrate that the agonist occupied wild-type secretin receptor is predominantly in a guanine nucleotide-sensitive high-affinity state and exhibits negative cooperativity, whereas the monomeric receptor is primarily in a guanine nucleotide-insensitive lower affinity state. We previously demonstrated constitutive homodimerization of this receptor through the lipid-exposed face of transmembrane (TM) IV. We now use cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of 14 TM IV residues, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), and functional analysis to map spatial approximations and functional importance of specific residues in this complex. All, except for three helix-facing mutants, trafficked to the cell surface, where secretin was shown to bind and elicit cAMP production. Cells expressing complementary-tagged receptors were treated with cuprous phenanthroline to establish disulfide bonds between spatially approximated cysteines. BRET was measured as an indication of receptor oligomerization and was repeated after competitive disruption of oligomers with TM IV peptide to distinguish covalent from noncovalent associations. Although all constructs generated a significant BRET signal, this was disrupted by peptide in all except for single-site mutants replacing five residues with cysteine. Of these, covalent stabilization of receptor homodimers through positions of Gly(243), Ile(247), and Ala(250) resulted in a GTP-sensitive high-affinity state of the receptor, whereas the same procedure with Ala(246) and Phe(240) mutants resulted in a GTP-insensitive lower affinity state. We propose the existence of a functionally important, structurally specific high-affinity dimeric state of the secretin receptor, which may be typical of family B G protein-coupled receptors

	19440631, ree energies and forces in helix-coil transition of homopolypeptides under stretching.We show here that constant velocity steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations of alpha-helices in a vacuum present a well defined plateau in the force-extension relationship for homopolypeptides having more than (approximately) twenty residues. With the processes being far away from equilibrium, the energies strongly depend on the stretching velocity. Importantly, for a given velocity variation, the energy variation depends also on the helix sequence. Additionally, our observations show that homopolypeptides made of ten different amino acids (Ala, Cys, Gln, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, Ser, Thr and Val) present a linear helix-coil transition

	19456859, lanine screening of the intracellular loops of the human bradykinin B receptor--effects on receptor maintenance, G protein activation and internalization.The bradykinin B(2) receptor is coupled to G protein G(q/11) and becomes sequestered into intracellular compartments after activation. To more closely define the receptor sequences involved in these processes and their functions, we systematically mutated all three intracellular loops (ICLs), either as point mutations or in groups of three to five amino acids to Ala, obtaining a total of 14 mutants. All constructs were stably expressed in HEK 293 cells and, with the exception of triple mutant DRY --&gt; AAA, retained the ability to specifically bind [(3)H]bradykinin. The binding affinities at 4 or 37 degrees C of several mutants differed considerably from those determined for the wild-type receptor, indicating an allosteric connection between the conformation of the binding site and that of the ICLs. Mutations in ICL-1 strongly reduced surface expression without affecting G protein signaling or [(3)H]bradykinin internalization. Two cluster mutants in the middle of ICL-2 containing basic residues displayed considerably reduced potencies, whereas two mutations in ICL-3 resulted in receptor conformations that were considered to be semi-active, based on the observation that they responded with phosphoinositide hydrolysis to compounds normally considered to be antagonists. This, and the fact that a cluster mutant at the C-terminal end of ICL-3 was signaling incompetent, hint at the involvement of ICL-2 and ICL-3 in G(q/11) activation, albeit with different functions. None of the mutants displayed reduced ligand-induced receptor internalization, indicating that the loops are not essential for this process. No conclusion could be drawn, however, with regard to the role of the DRY sequence, as the corresponding triplet mutation lacked binding capability

	19467627, he pH dependence of the allosteric response of human liver pyruvate kinase to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, ATP, and alanine.The allosteric regulation of human liver pyruvate kinase (hL-PYK) by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-BP; activator), ATP (inhibitor) and alanine (Ala; inhibitor) was monitored over a pH range from 6.5 to 8.0 at 37 degrees C. As a function of increasing pH, hL-PYK's affinity for the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), and for Fru-1,6-BP decreases, while affinities for ATP and alanine slightly increases. At pH 6.5, Fru-1,6-BP and ATP elicit only small allosteric impacts on PEP affinity. As pH increases, Fru-1,6-BP and ATP elicit greater allosteric responses, but the response to alanine is relatively constant. Since the magnitudes of the allosteric coupling for ATP and for alanine inhibition are different and the pH dependences of these magnitudes are not similar, these inhibitors likely elicit their responses using different molecular mechanisms. In addition, our results fail to support a general correlation between pH dependent changes in effector affinity and pH dependent changes in the corresponding allosteric response

	19475463, la54Thr polymorphism of fatty acid binding protein 2, role on insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk factors in presurgical morbid obesity patients.BACKGROUND: A transition G to A at codon 54 of fatty acid binding protein 2 (FABP2) results in an amino acid substitution (ala 54 to Thr 54). This polymorphism was associated with insulin resistance in some populations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of Thr54 polymorphism in the FABP2 gene on obesity anthropometric parameters, cardiovascular risk factors, and adipocytokines in patients with presurgical morbid obesity. DESIGN: A population of 55 morbid obese patients was enrolled. An indirect calorimetry, tetrapolar electrical bioimpedance, blood pressure, a serial assessment of nutritional intake with 3 days of written food records, and biochemical analysis (lipid profile, adipocytokines, insulin, C-reactive protein, and lipoprotein-a) were performed. The statistical analysis was performed for the combined Ala54/Thr54 and Thr54/Thr54 as a mutant-type group and wild-type group (Ala54/Ala54). RESULTS: Twenty nine (52.7%) had the genotype Ala54/Ala54 (wild-type group) and 26 (47.3%) patients had the genotype Ala54/Thr54 (24 patients, 43.7%) or Thr54/Thr54 (two patients, 3.6%; mutant-type group). Insulin (22.4 +/- 16.8 vs. 26.1 +/- 17.1 mg/dl; p = 0.04) and homeostasis model assessment (6.1 +/- 2.1 vs. 6.7 +/- 4.5; p = 0.04) levels were higher in mutant-type group than wild-type group. In mutant-type group, leptin levels (134.8 +/- 83 vs. 206.5 +/- 76 ng/ml; p = 0.03) were higher than wild-type group. Moreover, adiponectin levels (80.9 +/- 39.6 vs. 23.9 +/- 13.8 ng/ml; p = 0.02) were higher in wild-type group than mutant-type group. CONCLUSION: The novel finding of this study is the association of Thr54 allele with insulin resistance, leptin, and adiponectin levels in morbidly obese patients

	19483081, e>Ala scanning of the inhibitory region of cardiac troponin I.In skeletal and cardiac muscles, troponin (Tn), which resides on the thin filament, senses a change in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration. Tn is composed of TnC, TnI, and TnT. Ca(2+) binding to the regulatory domain of TnC removes the inhibitory effect by TnI on the contraction. The inhibitory region of cardiac TnI spans from residue 138 to 149. Upon Ca(2+) activation, the inhibitory region is believed to be released from actin, thus triggering actin-activation of myosin ATPase. In this study, we created a series of Ala-substitution mutants of cTnI to delineate the functional contribution of each amino acid in the inhibitory region to myofilament regulation. We found that most of the point mutations in the inhibitory region reduced the ATPase activity in the presence of Ca(2+), which suggests the same region also acts as an activator of the ATPase. The thin filaments can also be activated by strong myosin head (S1)-actin interactions. The binding of N-ethylmaleimide-treated myosin subfragment 1 (NEM-S1) to actin filaments mimics such strong interactions. Interestingly, in the absence of Ca(2+) NEM-S1-induced activation of S1 ATPase was significantly less with the thin filaments containing TnI(T144A) than that with the wild-type TnI. However, in the presence of Ca(2+), there was little difference in the activation of ATPase activity between these preparations

	19501421, nterocin C, a class IIb bacteriocin produced by E. faecalis C901, a strain isolated from human colostrum.Enterocin C (EntC), a class IIb bacteriocin was purified from culture supernatants of Enterococcus faecalis C901, a strain isolated from human colostrum. Enterocin C consists of two distinct peptides, named EntC1 and EntC2, whose complementary action is required for full antimicrobial activity. The structural genes entC1 and entC2 encoding enterocins EntC1 and EntC2, respectively, and that encoding the putative immunity protein (EntCI) are located in the 9-kb plasmid pEntC, harboured by E. faecalis C901. The N-terminal sequence of both antimicrobial peptides revealed that EntC1 (4284 Da) is identical to Ent1071A, one of the two peptides that form enterocin 1071 (Ent1071), a bacteriocin produced by E. faecalis BFE 1071. In contrast, EntC2 (3867 Da) presents the non-polar alanine residue at position 17 (Ala(17)) instead of the polar threonine residue (Thr(17)) in Ent1071B, the second peptide constituting Ent1071. In spite of peptide similarities, EntC differs from Ent1071 in major aspects, including the complementary activity among its constitutive peptides and its wider inhibitory spectrum of activity. Different amphiphilic alpha-helical conformations between EntC2 and Ent1071B could explain both, acquired complementary activity and increased antimicrobial spectrum

	19531490, hosphorylation-dependent autoinhibition of myosin light chain phosphatase accounts for Ca2+ sensitization force of smooth muscle contraction.The reversible regulation of myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) in response to agonist stimulation and cAMP/cGMP signals plays an important role in the regulation of smooth muscle (SM) tone. Here, we investigated the mechanism underlying the inhibition of MLCP induced by the phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT1), a regulatory subunit of MLCP, at Thr-696 and Thr-853 using glutathione S-transferase (GST)-MYPT1 fragments having the inhibitory phosphorylation sites. GST-MYPT1 fragments, including only Thr-696 and only Thr-853, inhibited purified MLCP (IC(50) = 1.6 and 60 nm, respectively) when they were phosphorylated with RhoA-dependent kinase (ROCK). The activities of isolated catalytic subunits of type 1 and type 2A phosphatases (PP1 and PP2A) were insensitive to either fragment. Phospho-GST-MYPT1 fragments docked directly at the active site of MLCP, and this was blocked by a PP1/PP2A inhibitor microcystin (MC)-LR or by mutation of the active sites in PP1. GST-MYPT1 fragments induced a contraction of beta-escin-permeabilized ileum SM at constant pCa 6.3 (EC(50) = 2 microm), which was eliminated by Ala substitution of the fragment at Thr-696 or by ROCK inhibitors or 8Br-cGMP. GST-MYPT1-(697-880) was 5-times less potent than fragments including Thr-696. Relaxation induced by 8Br-cGMP was not affected by Ala substitution at Ser-695, a known phosphorylation site for protein kinase A/G. Thus, GST-MYPT1 fragments are phosphorylated by ROCK in permeabilized SM and mimic agonist-induced inhibition and cGMP-induced activation of MLCP. We propose a model in which MYPT1 phosphorylation at Thr-696 and Thr-853 causes an autoinhibition of MLCP that accounts for Ca(2+) sensitization of smooth muscle force

	19537091, Autoimmune response in HIV-infected patients is directed against CD4 domain 4]Phage display epitope library technology and a novel computer algorithm have been used for the localization of CD4 epitopes specific for monoclonal antibody (mAb) T6 and autoimmune antibodies found in an HIV infected patient. Both predicted epitope clusters have been shown to overlap and to be localized within the domain 4 of CD4. They included Cys303, Glu304, Glu330, and Lys331 amino acids. Few amino acids predicted by the algorithm as the epitope residues and two residues that did not relate to the epitope were sequentially substituted for Ala. Further analysis of the mutated forms of sCD4 expressed in 293T cells transfected with the corresponding DNAs, supported the predicted localization of the mAb T6 epitope. The results demonstrate that the autoimmune response in HIV-infected patients is directed against domain D4 of sCD4

	19541927, mino acids in the rat intestinal lumen regulate their own absorption from a distant intestinal site.Intestinal nutrient transport is altered in response to changes in dietary conditions and luminal substrate level. It is not clear, however, whether an amino acid in the intestinal lumen can acutely affect its own absorption from a distant site. Our aim is to study the effect of an amino acid present in rat small intestinal segment on its own absorption from a proximal or distal site and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The effect of instillation of alanine (Ala) in either jejunum or ileum on its own absorption at ileal or jejunal level was examined in vivo. The modulation of this intestinal regulatory loop by the following interventions was studied: tetrodotoxin (TTX) added to Ala, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy, chemical ablation of capsaicin-sensitive primary afferent (CSPA) fibers, and IV administration of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist. In addition, the kinetics of jejunal Ala absorption and the importance of Na+-dependent transport were studied in vitro after instilling Ala in the ileum. Basal jejunal Ala absorption [0.198 +/- 0.018 micromol x cm(-1) x 20 min(-1) (means +/- SD)] was significantly decreased with the instillation of 20 mM Ala in the ileum or in an adjacent distal jejunal segment (0.12 +/- 0.015; P &lt; 0.0001 and 0.138 +/- 0.014; P &lt; 0.002, respectively). Comparable inhibition was observed in the presence of proline in the ileum. Moreover, basal Ala absorption from the ileum (0.169 +/- 0.025) was significantly decreased by the presence of 20 mM Ala in the jejunum (0.103 +/- 0.027; P &lt; 0.01). The inhibitory effect on jejunal Ala absorption was abolished by TTX, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy, neonatal capsaicin treatment, and CGRP antagonism. In vitro studies showed that Ala in the ileum affects Na+-mediated transport and increases K(m) without affecting Vmax. Intraluminal amino acids control their own absorption from a distant part of the intestine, by affecting the affinity of the Na+-mediated Ala transporter, through a neuronal mechanism that involves CSPA and CGRP

	19542229, he elucidation of the structure of Thermotoga maritima peptidoglycan reveals two novel types of cross-link.Thermotoga maritima is a Gram-negative, hyperthermophilic bacterium whose peptidoglycan contains comparable amounts of L- and D-lysine. We have determined the fine structure of this cell-wall polymer. The muropeptides resulting from the digestion of peptidoglycan by mutanolysin were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography and identified by amino acid analysis after acid hydrolysis, dinitrophenylation, enzymatic determination of the configuration of the chiral amino acids, and mass spectrometry. The high-performance liquid chromatography profile contained four main peaks, two monomers, and two dimers, plus a few minor peaks corresponding to anhydro forms. The first monomer was the d-lysine-containing disaccharide-tripeptide in which the D-Glu-D-Lys bond had the unusual gamma--&gt;epsilon arrangement (GlcNAc-MurNAc-L-Ala-gamma-D-Glu-epsilon-D-Lys). The second monomer was the conventional disaccharide-tetrapeptide (GlcNAc-MurNAc-L-Ala-gamma-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala). The first dimer contained a disaccharide-L-Ala as the acyl donor cross-linked to the alpha-amine of D-Lys in a tripeptide acceptor stem with the sequence of the first monomer. In the second dimer, donor and acceptor stems with the sequences of the second and first monomers, respectively, were connected by a D-Ala4-alpha-D-Lys3 cross-link. The cross-linking index was 10 with an average chain length of 30 disaccharide units. The structure of the peptidoglycan of T. maritima revealed for the first time the key role of D-Lys in peptidoglycan synthesis, both as a surrogate of L-Lys or meso-diaminopimelic acid at the third position of peptide stems and in the formation of novel cross-links of the L-Ala1(alpha--&gt;alpha)D-Lys3 and D-Ala4(alpha--&gt;alpha)D-Lys3 types

	19555106, ransport of free and peptide-bound pyrraline at intestinal and renal epithelial cells.Pyrraline is a quantitatively dominating glycation compound of the advanced Maillard reaction in foods and can be found in urine after consumption of pyrraline-containing food items. The purpose of this study was to investigate the transport of pyrraline and its dipeptide derivatives alanylpyrraline (Ala-Pyrr) and pyrralylalanine (Pyrr-Ala) at intestinal and renal cell lines. Pyrraline inhibited the l-[(3)H]lysine uptake with IC(50) values of 0.3 mM (Caco-2 cells) and 3.5 mM (OK cells), respectively, but not the uptake of [(14)C]Gly-Sar (Caco-2 and SKPT cells). In contrast, Ala-Pyrr strongly inhibited the uptake of [(14)C]Gly-Sar in Caco-2 and SKPT cells with IC(50) values of 0.19 and 0.017 mM, respectively. Pyrr-Ala inhibited the carrier-mediated uptake of [(14)C]Gly-Sar in Caco-2 and SKPT cells by 50% at concentrations of 0.03 and 0.008 mM, respectively. The transepithelial flux of peptide-bound pyrraline across Caco-2 cell monolayers was up to 15-fold higher compared to the flux of free pyrraline. We conclude that free pyrraline is not a substrate for the intestinal lysine transporter and that the absorption of dietary pyrraline occurs most likely in the form of dipeptides rather than as the free amino acid

	19558269, olymorphism of Pro12Ala in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 gene in Iranian diabetic and obese subjects.BACKGROUND: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 (PPARgamma2) is a nuclear receptor that regulates adipocyte differentiation, lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the Pro12Ala single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the PPARgamma2 gene and type II diabetes (T2DM) and obesity in an Iranian population. METHODS: The genomic DNA of the 312 subjects included four groups: (1) nonobese with type II diabetes, (2) obese without type II diabetes, (3) obese with type II diabetes, and (4) nondiabetic nonobese controls. The Pro12Ala polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. RESULTS: Frequencies of the Ala allele in obese subjects were significantly different from those control subjects (odds ratio [OR], 2.358; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.101-5.05) (P = 0.025). In contrast, no significant association was detected between the Pro12Ala polymorphism and type II diabetes (OR, 0.652; 95% CI, 0.261-1.628). In all subjects, the Ala carriers had a higher body mass index (BMI) compared with the common allele. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the Pro12Ala polymorphism in the PPARgamma2 gene is associated with obesity in Iranian subjects and the presence of the Ala allele could predict higher BMI

	19569641, ntra- and intermolecular effects on 1H chemical shifts in a silk model Peptide determined by high-field solid state 1H NMR and empirical calculations.A combination of solid state 1H NMR chemical shift measurements and empirical chemical shift calculations has been used to interpret 1H solid state chemical shifts of a model peptide (Ala-Gly)15 for the crystalline domain of Bombyx mori silk fibroin in silk I and silk II structures, including a treatment of both intra- and intermolecular arrangements. Silk I and silk II are the structures of silk fibroin before and after spinning, respectively. Two peaks with equal intensity were observed for the amide protons of (AG)15 in silk I, whereas only one broad peak was observed for silk II, reflecting a difference of 1.1 ppm in Ala HN shift between silk I and silk II, but a difference of only 0.2 ppm in Gly HN shift. Chemical shift calculations predicted chemical shifts that are in good agreement with the experimental observations and showed that the origin of these chemical shift differences was predominantly the magnetic anisotropy effect from the C=O bond that hydrogen bonds with HN, which has a more favorable geometry for Ala HN in silk II than for the other HN. This result shows that we could distinguish between proton chemical shift effects arising from intermolecular interactions and those from intramolecular interactions by combining observation of the solid state 1H NMR chemical shift and empirical chemical shift calculation

	19572624, nravelling the conformational dynamics of the aqueous alanine dipeptide with first-principle molecular dynamics.First principle DFT-based molecular dynamics simulations are performed in order to bring new insights into the conformational dynamics of the alanine dipeptide analogue Ac-Ala-NHMe (with methyl group caps at the extremities) immersed in liquid water at ambient temperature. Two simulations have been run for a total of 100 ps, which allows for a relevant statistical sampling of the phase space, at the ab initio level. PII-beta equilibrium and (PII-beta)-alphaR conformational interconversions are obtained, without a free-energy barrier for the Phi angle and with a rather low barrier of 2-3 kcal/mol for the Psi angle, easily overcome from solute-solvent energy transfers. We furthermore give first insights into the rather strong zwitterionic character of the peptide bonds of the dipeptide when immersed in the liquid. The structural and zwitterionic properties extracted from first-principle dynamics in the liquid phase will be useful as benchmarks for force field developments

	19581575, ynamics of locking of peptides onto growing amyloid fibrils.Sequence-dependent variations in the growth mechanism and stability of amyloid fibrils, which are implicated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, are poorly understood. We have carried out extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to monitor the structural changes that occur upon addition of random coil (RC) monomer fragments from the yeast prion Sup35 and Abeta-peptide onto a preformed fibril. Using the atomic resolution structures of the microcrystals as the starting points, we show that the RC --&gt; beta-strand transition for the Sup35 fragment occurs abruptly over a very narrow time interval, whereas the acquisition of strand content is less dramatic for the hydrophobic-rich Abeta-peptide. Expulsion of water, resulting in the formation of a dry interface between 2 adjacent sheets of the Sup35 fibril, occurs in 2 stages. Ejection of a small number of discrete water molecules in the second stage follows a rapid decrease in the number of water molecules in the first stage. Stability of the Sup35 fibril is increased by a network of hydrogen bonds involving both backbone and side chains, whereas the marginal stability of the Abeta-fibrils is largely due to the formation of weak dispersion interaction between the hydrophobic side chains. The importance of the network of hydrogen bonds is further illustrated by mutational studies, which show that substitution of the Asn and Gln residues to Ala compromises the Sup35 fibril stability. Despite the similarity in the architecture of the amyloid fibrils, the growth mechanism and stability of the fibrils depend dramatically on the sequence

	19586804, etermination of D-serine and D-alanine in the tissues and physiological fluids of mice with various D-amino-acid oxidase activities using two-dimensional high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection.Two-dimensional-HPLC procedures have been established for the sensitive and selective determination of D-serine (D-Ser) and D-alanine (D-Ala), and their amounts in the tissues and physiological fluids of mice with various D-amino-acid oxidase (DAO) activities have been demonstrated. These two D-amino acids are modulators of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor mediated neurotransmission, and the alterations in their amounts following the changes in the DAO activity are matters of interest. After pre-column derivatization with 4-fluoro-7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (NBD-F), the D-amino acids were determined by the 2D-HPLC system with fluorescence detectors. As the first dimension, a microbore-monolithic-ODS column (750 mm x 0.53 mm I.D.) was adopted and a self-packed narrowbore-Pirkle type enantioselective column (Sumichiral OA-2500S, 250 mm x 1.5 mm I.D.) was selected for the second dimension. The lower limits of quantitation of D-Ser and D-Ala were 500 amol, and the within-day and day-to-day precisions were less than 6.8%. Using these methods, the amounts of D-Ser and D-Ala in 6 brain tissues, 4 peripheral tissues, serum and urine of mice having various DAO activities were determined; the amounts of these D-amino acids were drastically increased with a lowering of the DAO activity except for the cases of D-Ser in the frontal brain regions. The present micro-2D-HPLC procedures are powerful tools for the determination of small amounts of D-Ser and D-Ala in mammalian samples, and the obtained results would be useful for developing novel drugs that modulate the DAO activity, such as DAO inhibitors, against neuronal diseases

	19618277, robing the urea dependence of residual structure in denatured human alpha-lactalbumin.Backbone (15)N relaxation parameters and (15)N-(1)H(N) residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) have been measured for a variant of human alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-LA) in 4, 6, 8 and 10 M urea. In the alpha-LA variant, the eight cysteine residues in the protein have been replaced by alanines (all-Ala alpha-LA). This protein is a partially folded molten globule at pH 2 and has been shown previously to unfold in a stepwise non-cooperative manner on the addition of urea. (15)N R(2) values in some regions of all-Ala alpha-LA show significant exchange broadening which is reduced as the urea concentration is increased. Experimental RDC data are compared with RDCs predicted from a statistical coil model and with bulkiness, average area buried upon folding and hydrophobicity profiles in order to identify regions of non-random structure. Residues in the regions corresponding to the B, D and C-terminal 3(10) helices in native alpha-LA show R(2) values and RDC data consistent with some non-random structural propensities even at high urea concentrations. Indeed, for residues 101-106 the residual structure persists in 10 M urea and the RDC data suggest that this might include the formation of a turn-like structure. The data presented here allow a detailed characterization of the non-cooperative unfolding of all-Ala alpha-LA at higher concentrations of denaturant and complement previous studies which focused on structural features of the molten globule which is populated at lower concentrations of denaturant

	19620709, tructural and molecular mechanism for autoprocessing of MARTX toxin of Vibrio cholerae at multiple sites.The multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin (MARTX) toxin of Vibrio cholerae causes destruction of the actin cytoskeleton by covalent cross-linking of actin and inactivation of Rho GTPases. The effector domains responsible for these activities are here shown to be independent proteins released from the large toxin by autoproteolysis catalyzed by an embedded cysteine protease domain (CPD). The CPD is activated upon binding inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP(6)). In this study, we demonstrated that InsP(6) is not simply an allosteric cofactor, but rather binding of InsP(6) stabilized the CPD structure, facilitating formation of the enzyme-substrate complex. The 1.95-A crystal structure of this InsP(6)-bound unprocessed form of CPD was determined and revealed the scissile bond Leu(3428)-Ala(3429) captured in the catalytic site. Upon processing at this site, CPD was converted to a form with 500-fold reduced affinity for InsP(6), but was reactivated for high affinity binding of InsP(6) by cooperative binding of both a new substrate and InsP(6). Reactivation of CPD allowed cleavage of the MARTX toxin at other sites, specifically at leucine residues between the effector domains. Processed CPD also cleaved other proteins in trans, including the leucine-rich protein YopM, demonstrating that it is a promiscuous leucine-specific protease

	19624237, etwork of hydrogen bonds in Pro-Ala-Pro and Pro-Phe-Pro diamides: a first principles study of Ala--&gt;Phe point mutation in proline environment.Intramolecular hydrogen bonding in the Pro-Ala-Pro and Pro-Phe-Pro tripeptides has been characterized using Bader's atoms in molecule (AIM) analyses of relevant electron density topologies. The properties of hydrogen bonds with corresponding ring strains were investigated. Good correlations along the decrease in electron densities at ring critical points were examined from five- to ten-membered hydrogen-bound ring sizes; seven-membered rings being the most energetically favored. AIM analysis confirms the logical conclusion that the molecule has to become very compact to form as many hydrogen bonds as possible. The relatively large hydrogen bond stabilization attributed to the pronounced network of interactions comes at the  energetic expense  of a relatively large internal repulsion due to the compactness of the structures. The net balanced result was a very modest increase in the zero point corrected conformation energy (DeltaE(ZPEC)). These findings aid in establishing hydrogen bonding rules in reductionist  bottoms-up  approaches to peptide and protein folding

	19643731, agnitude of a conformational change in the glycine receptor beta1-beta2 loop is correlated with agonist efficacy.The efficacy of agonists at Cys-loop ion channel receptors is determined by the rate they isomerize receptors to a pre-open flip state. Once the flip state is reached, the shut-open reaction is similar for low and high efficacy agonists. The present study sought to identify a conformational change associated with the closed-flip transition in the alpha1-glycine receptor. We employed voltage-clamp fluorometry to compare ligand-binding domain conformational changes induced by the following agonists, listed from highest to lowest affinity and efficacy: glycine &gt; beta-alanine &gt; taurine. Voltage-clamp fluorometry involves labeling introduced cysteines with environmentally sensitive fluorophores and inferring structural rearrangements from ligand-induced fluorescence changes. Agonist affinity and efficacy correlated inversely with maximum fluorescence magnitudes at labeled residues in ligand-binding domain loops D and E, suggesting that large conformational changes in this region preclude efficacious gating. However, agonist affinity and efficacy correlated directly with maximum fluorescence magnitudes from a label attached to A52C in loop 2, near the transmembrane domain interface. Because glycine experiences the largest affinity increase between closed and flip states, we propose that the magnitude of this fluorescence signal is directly proportional to the agonist affinity increase. In contrast, labeled residues in loops C, F, and the pre-M1 domain yielded agonist-independent fluorescence responses. Our results support the conclusion that a closed-flip conformation change, with a magnitude proportional to the agonist affinity increase from closed to flip states, occurs in the microenvironment of Ala-52

	19651525, harge-separation reactions of doubly-protonated peptides: effect of peptide chain length.The collision induced dissociation of doubly-protonated (Ala)(x)His (x = 5, 6, 7, 8, 10) peptides have been studied. The major fragmentation reactions observed are symmetrical amide bond cleavages to give the complementary b(m) and y(N-m) ions, where N is the total number of residues in the peptide. Minor asymmetric cleavage to give doubly-protonated y ions also is observed, involving cleavage near the N-terminus. The shorter peptides (x = 5, 6, 7) show major cleavage of the second amide bond to yield b2 and y(N-2) ions, while (Ala)10His shows major symmetrical cleavage at the fourth and fifth amide bonds. (Ala)8His appears to be a transitional peptide in showing substantial symmetrical cleavage at the second, fourth, and fifth amide bonds. The results are in general agreement with the bifurcating nature of charge separation noted by Zubarev (J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom.2008, 19, 1755-1763) from a statistical analysis of a large body of doubly-protonated tryptic peptide CID mass spectra. It is shown that the b2 ion derived from doubly-protonated (Ala)5His has a protonated oxazolone structure

	19651526, n the charge partitioning between c and z fragments formed after electron-capture induced dissociation of charge-tagged Lys-Lys and Ala-Lys dipeptide dications.Here we report on the charge partition between c and z fragments formed after femtosecond collisional electron-transfer from Cs atoms to charge-tagged peptide dications. Peptides chosen for study were Ala-Lys (AK) and Lys-Lys (KK) where one or both of the lysine epsilon-amino groups were trimethylated to provide one or two fixed charges. For peptides with only one charge tag, the other charge was obtained by protonation of an amino group. In some experiments the ammonium group was tagged by 18-crown-6-ether (CE). Since recombination energies decrease in the order: MeNH3+ &gt; NMe4+ &gt; MeNH3+(CE) &gt; NMe4+(CE), it is possible to change the probability for the transferred electron to end up at either the N-terminal or the C-terminal residue by CE attachment. We find, however, that the individual recombination energies have little influence on the relative ratio between the yield of c and z ions as long as there are no mobile protons that can be transferred between the two fragments. Our results can be accounted for by the Utah-Washington model where the electron is captured into an amide pi* orbital that weakens the N-C(alpha) bond and causes its breakage, followed by proton, electron, or hydrogen transfer between the c and z fragments that stay together as an ion-molecule complex for some time. The data are also in accordance with the notion that an amide group competes with the charged groups for the electron. Electron capture by charged groups results in loss of small neutrals such as hydrogen and ammonia

	19657841,  second case of Hb Fontainebleau [alpha21(B2)Ala--&gt;Pro] in an individual with microcytosis.The identification of a second case of Hb Fontainbleau [alpha21(B2)Ala--&gt;Pro] allowed us to re-examine its association with microcytosis, explore the effects of the mutation on protein stability and define the mutation at a DNA level. Although slightly unstable, the variant was expressed at 28-29% of the total and was caused by a heterozygous mutation in the alpha2 gene. There was no evidence for concomitant alpha-thalassemia (alpha-thal); both alpha-globin gene deletion analysis and sequencing of the alpha-globin locus failed to detect any additional mutations that might explain the relatively high expression level

	19663475, heoretical and experimental studies on alpha/epsilon-hybrid peptides: design of a 14/12-helix from peptides with alternating (S)-C-linked carbo-epsilon-amino acid [(S)-epsilon-Caa((x))] and L-ala.An (S)-C-linked carbo-epsilon-amino acid [(S)-epsilon-Caa((x))] was prepared from the known (S)-delta-Caa. This monomer was utilized together with l-Ala to give novel alpha/epsilon-hybrid peptides in 1:1 alternation. Conformational analysis on penta- and hexapeptides by NMR (in CDCl(3)), CD, and MD studies led to the identification of robust 14/12-mixed helices. This is in agreement with the data from a theoretical conformational analysis on the basis of ab initio MO theory providing a complete overview on all formally possible hydrogen-bonded helix patterns of alpha/epsilon-hybrid peptides with 1:1 backbone alternation. The  new motif  of a mixed 14/12-helix was predicted as most stable in vacuum. Obviously, the formation of ordered secondary structures is also possible in peptide foldamers with amino acid constituents of considerable backbone lengths. Thus, alpha/epsilon-hybrid peptides expand the domain of foldamers and allow the introduction of desired functionalities via the alpha-amino acid constituents

	19694805, ptimization of D-amino acid oxidase for low substrate concentrations--towards a cancer enzyme therapy.D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) has recently become of interest as a biocatalyst for industrial applications and for therapeutic treatments. It has been used in gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapies, in which its production of H2O2 in tumor cells can be regulated by administration of substrate. This approach is limited by the locally low O2 concentration and the high K(m) for this substrate. Using the directed evolution approach, one DAAO mutant was identified that has increased activity at low O2 and D-Ala concentrations and a 10-fold lower K(m) for O2. We report on the mechanism of this DAAO variant and on its cytotoxicity towards various mammalian cancer cell lines. The higher activity observed at low O2 and D-Ala concentrations results from a combination of modifications of specific kinetic steps, each being of small magnitude. These results highlight the potential in vivo applicability of this evolved mutant DAAO for tumor therapy

	19714641, DAM-8 isolated from human osteoarthritic chondrocytes cleaves fibronectin at Ala(271).OBJECTIVE: Fibronectin fragments are thought to play a critical role in the initiation and progression of cartilage degradation in arthritis. In a recent study, fibronectin neoepitopes resulting from cleavage of intact fibronectin at the Ala(271)/Val(272) scissile bond, generating an approximately 30-kd fragment with the new C-terminus VRAA(271) and an approximately 50-85-kd fragment with the new N-terminus (272)VYQP, were identified in osteoarthritis (OA) cartilage. The present study was undertaken to isolate the enzymes responsible for this cleavage from human OA chondrocytes. METHODS: Fibronectin-degrading activity in human OA chondrocyte-conditioned medium (OACCM) was purified using conventional chromatography. A fluorescent peptide was developed based on the fibronectin scissile bond (269)RAA downward arrowVal(272), and this peptide was used to track fibronectinase activity during purification. Western blotting with antibodies that detect the fibronectin neoepitopes VRAA(271) and (272)VYQP was used to confirm cleavage of intact fibronectin by the enzymatically active fractions. Mass spectrometry was used to identify the proteins found in the fibronectinase-enriched fractions, with further confirmation by Western blotting. In addition, a recombinant enzyme identified by mass spectrometry was tested by Western blotting and dimethylmethylene blue assay for its ability to produce fibronectin neoepitopes in OA cartilage. RESULTS: Purification of OACCM by chromatography resulted in isolation of a fibronectin-degrading enzyme, and mass spectrometry identified ADAM-8 as the fibronectinase present in these preparations. Furthermore, treatment of OA cartilage with recombinant human ADAM-8 promoted cartilage catabolism. CONCLUSION: The results of this study identify ADAM-8 as a fibronectinase in human OA chondrocytes. Because ADAM-8 is capable of producing the fibronectin neoepitopes VRAA(271) and (272)VYQP in human OA cartilage, this enzyme may be an important mediator of cartilage catabolism

	19720797, mpact of the PPAR-gamma2 Pro12Ala polymorphism and ACE inhibitor therapy on new-onset microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetes: evidence from BENEDICT.OBJECTIVE: Cross-sectional studies found less microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients with the Ala12 allele of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2 (PPAR-gamma2) Pro12Ala polymorphism. We prospectively evaluated the association between Pro12Ala polymorphism (rs1801282) and new-onset microalbuminuria. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Pro12Ala polymorphism was genotyped by TaqMan-based assay in genomic DNA of 1,119 consenting patients from BErgamo NEphrologic DIabetic Complications Trial (BENEDICT)-a prospective, randomized trial evaluating ACE inhibition effect on new-onset microalbuminuria (albuminuria 20-200 microg/min in at least two of three consecutive overnight urine collections in two consecutive visits) in hypertensive type 2 diabetes with albuminuria &lt;20 microg/min at inclusion. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of Ala (Ala/Ala or Ala/Pro) carriers and Pro/Pro homozygotes were similar, with a nonsignificant trend to lower albuminuria (P = 0.1107) in the 177 Ala carriers. Over a median (interquartile range) of 44.0 (17.1-51.9) months, 7 (4%) Ala carriers and 86 (9.1%) Pro/Pro homozygotes developed microalbuminuria (hazard ratio [HR] 0.45 [95% CI 0.21-0.97]; P = 0.042). Final albuminuria was significantly lower in Ala carriers than Pro/Pro homozygotes (7.3 +/- 9.1 vs. 10.5 +/- 24.9 microg/min, respectively), even after adjustment for baseline albuminuria (P = 0.048). Baseline and follow-up blood pressure and metabolic control were similar in both groups. Incidence of microalbuminuria was significantly decreased by ACE versus non-ACE inhibitor therapy in Pro/Pro homozygotes (6.3 vs. 11.9%, respectively, HR 0.46 [0.29-0.72]; P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In type 2 diabetes, the Ala allele protects from worsening albuminuria and new-onset microalbuminuria, and ACE inhibition blunts the excess risk of microalbuminuria associated with the Pro/Pro genotype. Evaluating Pro12Ala polymorphism may help identifying patients at risk who may benefit the most from early renoprotective therapy

	19733160, ender-specific effect of Pro12Ala polymorphism in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-2 gene on obesity risk and leptin levels in a Tunisian population.OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to investigate the impact of the Pro12Ala (rs1801282) polymorphism of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-2 (PPARgamma-2) gene on obesity or body mass index (BMI) and plasma leptin, insulin, adiponectin and lipid levels in a sample of the Tunisian population. DESIGN AND METHODS: The study included 387 obese patients and 288 control subjects. The Pro12Ala genotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction followed by a digestion with the restriction of endonuclease BstUI. RESULTS: In the whole population, there is no significant difference in genotype frequencies of the Pro12Ala polymorphism between obese patients and controls. However, separate analysis by gender revealed that obese men (but not women) had significantly higher frequency of Pro/Ala genotypes compared to controls (12.2% vs. 4.1%; chi(2)=6.76, p=0.009). In comparison to Pro/Pro homozygotes, Ala-allele bearers had a significantly higher risk of obesity [OR (95% CI)=3.26 (1.28-8.33)]. When obese subjects were stratified according to type 2 diabetes status, the association with obesity was only significant in obese non-diabetic patients [OR (95% CI)=3.74 (1.43-9.74), p=0.007]. Additionally, obese male patients carrying the Ala-allele had significantly higher body mass index (p=0.007) and plasma leptin levels (p=0.023) compared to those homozygous for Pro-allele. The significant effect of Pro12Ala polymorphism on plasma leptin levels disappeared after adjustment for age and BMI. CONCLUSION: The present study provides evidence that the Pro12Ala polymorphism of the PPARgamma-2 gene is associated with obesity in non-diabetic men from Tunisian origin

	19734890, xidant-induced apoptosis is mediated by oxidation of the actin-regulatory protein cofilin.Physiological oxidants that are generated by activated phagocytes comprise the main source of oxidative stress during inflammation. Oxidants such as taurine chloramine (TnCl) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) can damage proteins and induce apoptosis, but the role of specific protein oxidation in this process has not been defined. We found that the actin-binding protein cofilin is a key target of oxidation. When oxidation of this single regulatory protein is prevented, oxidant-induced apoptosis is inhibited. Oxidation of cofilin causes it to lose its affinity for actin and to translocate to the mitochondria, where it induces swelling and cytochrome c release by mediating opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP). This occurs independently of Bax activation and requires both oxidation of cofilin Cys residues and dephosphorylation at Ser 3. Knockdown of endogenous cofilin using targeted siRNA inhibits oxidant-induced apoptosis, which is restored by re-expression of wild-type cofilin but not by cofilin containing Cys to Ala mutations. Exposure of cofilin to TnCl results in intramolecular disulphide bonding and oxidation of Met residues to Met sulphoxide, but only Cys oxidation causes cofilin to induce mitochondrial damage

	19746945, onformation of the phosphate D-alanine zwitterion in bacterial teichoic acid from nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.The conformation of d-alanine (d-Ala) groups of bacterial teichoic acid is a central, yet untested, paradigm of microbiology. The d-Ala binds via the C-terminus, thereby allowing the amine to exist as a free cationic NH(3)(+) group with the ability to form a contact ion pair with the nearby anionic phosphate group. This conformation hinders metal chelation by the phosphate because the zwitterion pair is charge neutral. To the contrary, the repulsion of cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) is attributed to the presence of the d-Ala cation; thus the ion pair does not form in this model. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has been used to measure the distance between amine and phosphate groups within cell wall fragments of Bacillus subtilis. The bacteria were grown on media containing (15)N d-Ala and beta-chloroalanine racemase inhibitor. The rotational-echo double-resonance (REDOR) pulse sequence was used to measure the internuclear dipolar coupling, and the results demonstrate (1) the metal-free amine-to-phosphate distance is 4.4 A and (2) the amine-to-phosphate distance increases to 5.4 A in the presence of Mg(2+) ions. As a result, the zwitterion exists in a nitrogen-oxygen ion pair configuration providing teichoic acid with a positive charge to repel CAMPs. Additionally, the amine of d-Ala does not prevent magnesium chelation in contradiction to the prevailing view of teichoic acids in metal binding. Thus, the NMR-based description of teichoic acid structure resolves the contradictory models, advances the basic understanding of cell wall biochemistry, and provides possible insight into the creation of new antibiotic therapies

	19748470,  liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay for Marfey's derivatives of L-Ala, D-Ala, and D-Ala-D-Ala: application to the in vivo confirmation of alanine racemase as the target of cycloserine in Escherichia coli.Bacterial cell wall biosynthesis is the target of several antibacterial agents and is also of interest as a target for future antibacterial agent development. Given the now widespread availability of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) instruments, the development of LC-MS/MS assays for cell wall biosynthesis intermediates would fill a needed gap in the analytical methodology available for antibacterial agent discovery and characterization. An LC-MS/MS assay for several early cell wall intermediates-L-Ala, D-Ala, and D-Ala-D-Ala-has been developed. This method relies on derivatization of bacterial extracts with Marfey's reagent. Marfey's reagent adducts of L-Ala and D-Ala were cleanly separated chromatographically, allowing Marfey's adducts of D-Ala and L-Ala to be separated prior to mass spectrometry (MS) detection and quantitation. The Marfey's adduct of D-Ala-D-Ala was also readily detectable using this same approach. This method shows good linearity (R(2)&gt;0.99), with a lower limit of quantitation of 1 pmol. This assay was demonstrated for characterization of the in vivo effect of cycloserine on Escherichia coli. Cycloserine resulted in a dramatic lowering of both D-Ala and D-Ala-D-Ala levels. Ampicillin had little effect on levels of these three metabolites, consistent with the actions of ampicillin on the later stages of cell wall biosynthesis. These observations indicate that cycloserine inhibits alanine racemase production of D-Ala in E. coli and demonstrates the utility of this assay in directly assessing D-Ala branch targeted antibacterial agents

	19756960, anganese superoxide dismutase: effect of the ala16val polymorphism on protein, activity, and mRNA levels in human breast cancer cell lines and stably transfected mouse embryonic fibroblasts.The manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) ala16val polymorphism has been associated with various diseases including breast cancer. In the present study, we investigated levels of MnSOD protein, enzymatic activity, and mRNA with respect to MnSOD genotype in several human breast carcinoma cell lines and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), developed from the MnSOD knockout mouse, stably expressing human MnSOD-ala and MnSOD-val. In human breast cell lines, the MnSOD-ala allele was associated with increased levels of MnSOD protein and MnSOD protein per unit mRNA. In the MEF transformants, MnSOD activity correlated fairly well with MnSOD protein levels. MnSOD mRNA expression was significantly lower in MnSOD-ala versus MnSOD-val lines. MnSOD protein and activity levels were not related to MnSOD genotype in the transformed MEF, although, as observed in the human breast cell lines, the MEF human MnSOD-ala lines produced significantly more human MnSOD protein per unit mRNA than the human MnSOD-val lines. This suggests that there is more efficient production of MnSOD-ala protein compared to MnSOD-val protein. Examination of several indicators of reactive oxygen species levels, including superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, in wild-type MEF and in MEF expressing similar elevated amounts of MnSOD-ala or val activity did not show differences related to the levels of MnSOD protein expression. In conclusion, in both human breast carcinoma cell lines and MEF cell lines stably transfected with human MnSOD, the MnSOD-ala allele was associated with increased production of MnSOD protein per unit mRNA indicating a possible imbalance in MnSOD protein production from the MnSOD-val mRNA

	19766907, ro12Ala polymorphism in PPARgamma2 associated with depression in Chinese nonagenarians/centenarians.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The Pro12Ala polymorphism of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) has been associated with decreased obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and other age-associated diseases such as cognitive impairment, hypertension, cancer, osteoarthritis. Each one of these diseases had been linked to depression. Moreover, there is also an association between Pro12 Ala polymorphism in PPAR gamma2 and longevity. The aim of the study was to evaluate the association between Pro12 Ala polymorphism and depression in Chinese nonagenarians and centenarians. METHODS: The sample included 697 unrelated Chinese nonagenarians/centenarians (aged between 90-108 years, mean age: 93.5+/-3.35 years; 67.2% women). The Pro12Ala variant was examined using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Depression was measured with brief 23-item Geriatrics Depression Scale Chinese-edition (GDS-CD). RESULTS: In this sample, the genotype frequencies of the Pro12Ala polymorphism were 0% Ala12Ala, 9.2% Pro12Ala, 90.8% Pro12Pro and the prevalence of depression was 25.3%. Subjects who were 12Ala carriers had significantly lower prevalence of depression than those who were not 12Ala carriers (14.06 vs. 26.38%, p=0.034). Subjects without depression also had a higher frequency of 12Ala gene than those with depression (5.28 vs. 2.56%, p=0.031). Adjusting for certain clinical factors that may be associated with depression or with 12Ala carriers, multiple logistic regressions showed the 12Ala gene was associated with decreased incidence of depression. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we found that among Chinese nonagenarians and centenarians, the Pro12Ala polymorphism in PPARgamma2 was associated with depression and that the 12Ala gene may be a factor for decreased depression

	19767579, mp-20 and Klk4 cleavage site preferences for amelogenin sequences.Mmp-20 and Klk4 are the two key enamel proteases. Can both enzymes process amelogenin to generate the major cleavage products that accumulate during the secretory stage of amelogenesis? We isolated Mmp-20 and Klk4 from developing pig teeth and used them to digest the tyrosine-rich amelogenin polypeptide (TRAP), the leucine-rich amelogenin protein (LRAP), and 5 fluorescence peptides. We characterized the digestion products by LC-MSMS, SDS-PAGE, and C18 RP-HPLC monitored with fluorescence and UV detectors. Mmp-20 cleaves amelogenin sequences after Pro(162), Ser(148), His(62), Ala(63), and Trp(45). These cleavages generate all of the major cleavage products that accumulate in porcine secretory-stage enamel: the 23-kDa, 20-kDa, 13-kDa, 11-kDa, and 6-kDa (TRAP) amelogenins. Mmp-20 cleaves LRAP after Pro(45) and Pro(40), producing the two LRAP products previously identified in tooth extracts. Among these key cleavage sites, Klk4 was able to cleave only after His(62). We propose that Mmp-20 alone processes amelogenin during the secretory stage

	19778418, utagenesis of the fusion peptide-like domain of hepatitis C virus E1 glycoprotein: involvement in cell fusion and virus entry.BACKGROUND: Envelope (E) glycoprotein E2 of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) mediates binding of the virus to target cell receptors. Nevertheless, the precise role of E1 in viral entry remains elusive. METHODS: To understand the involvement of the fusion peptide-like domain positioned at residues 264 to 290 within envelope glycoprotein E1 in HCV infection, mutants with Ala and Asn substitutions for residues conserved between HCV and E proteins of flaviviruses or the fusion proteins of paramyxoviruses were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and their effects on membrane fusion and viral infectivity were examined. RESULTS: None of these mutations affected the synthesis or cell surface expression of envelope proteins, nor did they alter the formation of a non-covalent E1-E2 heterodimer or E2 binding to the large extracellular loop of CD81. The Cys residues located at positions 272 and 281 were unlikely involved in intra- or intermolecular disulfide bond formation. With the exception of the G267A mutant, which showed increased cell fusion, other mutants displayed reduced or marginally inhibited cell fusion capacities compared to the wild-type (WT) E1E2. The G267A mutant was also an exception in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)/HCV E1E2 pseudotyping analyses, in that it showed higher one-cycle infectivity; all other mutants exhibited greatly or partially reduced viral entry versus the WT pseudotype. All but the G278A and D279N mutants showed a WT-like profile of E1E2 incorporation into HIV-1 particles. Since C272A, C281A, G282A, and G288A pseudotypes bound to Huh7 cells as effectively as did the WT pseudotype, the reduced infectivity of these pseudotypes was due to their ability to inhibit cell fusion. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that specific residues, but not the structure, of this fusion peptide-like domain are required for mediating cell fusion and viral entry

	19822347, ormation of chloroform during chlorination of alanine in drinking water.Currently, dissolved nitrogenous organic matters in water, important precursors of disinfection by-products (DBPs), are of significant concern. This study was to explore the formation of chloroform (CF) during chlorination of alanine (Ala), an important nitrogenous organic compound commonly present in water sources. Our results indicated that the CF yield reached a maximum value of 0.143% at the molar ratio of chlorine atom to nitrogen atom (Cl/N)=1.0 over a Cl/N range of 0.2-5.0 (pH=7.0, reaction time=5d, and initial Ala=0.1mM). At an acidic-neutral condition (pH 4-7), the formation of CF was suppressed. However, the highest CF yield (0.227%) occurred at weakly alkaline condition (pH 8.0) (initial Ala=0.1mM, and Cl/N=1.0). The increase of Br(-) in water can increase total trihalomethanes (THMs) and bromo-THMs. However, the bromo-THMs level reached a plateau at Br(-)/Cl&gt;0.04. Finally, based on the computation of frontier electron density and identification and measurement of key intermediates during Ala chlorination, we proposed a formation pathway of CF from Ala chlorination: Ala--&gt;monochloro-N-alanine (MC-N-Ala)--&gt;acetaldehyde (AAld)--&gt;monochloroacetaldehyde acetaldehyde (MCAld)--&gt;dichloroacetaldehyde (DCAld)--&gt;trichloroacetaldehyde (TCAld)--&gt;CF

	19826674, omochiral, helical metal-organic framework structures organized by strong, non-covalent pi-pi stacking interactions.A new trifunctional ligand, L(ala), containing a carboxylate donor group, a homochiral center derived from L-alanine and a strong pi-pi stacking, 1,8-naphthalimide synthon, has been used to prepare the copper(II) complex [Cu(L(ala))2(4,4'-bipy)(H2O)2].4.25H2O that has a homochiral, helical, supramolecular metal-organic framework 3-D structure, organized in one dimension solely by strong non-covalent forces

	19826919, -Alanine augments rhizobacteria-induced systemic resistance in cucumber.Bacillus vallismortis strain EXTN-1 is a proven biotic elicitor of systemic resistance in many crops against various pathogens. L: -Alanine (Ala) was tested in cucumber as a chemical elicitor of induced systemic resistance (ISR) against Colletotrichum orbiculare. In the greenhouse, both Ala and EXTN-1 induced significant levels of disease suppression in cucumber against anthracnose. When cucumber plants were treated with EXTN-1 and Ala together, augmentative disease suppression was observed. Experiments with transgenic tobacco plants carrying pathogenesis-related genes fused with the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reported gene (PR-1a::GUS &amp; PDF 1.2::GUS) showed an enhanced activation of both PR-1a and PDF 1.2 genes upon combined treatment with Ala and EXTN-1. RT-PCR analysis with transgenic (PR-1a or PDF 1.2 over expressing) Arabidopsis plant showed more enhanced expression of resistance genes PR-1a and PDF 1.2 upon combined treatment with Ala and EXTN-1 than either alone. An augmentative ISR effect, when the bacterial elicitor and chemical elicitor were combined together, was confirmed

	19827760, hemical labeling strategy with (R)- and (S)-trifluoromethylalanine for solid state 19F NMR analysis of peptaibols in membranes.Substitution of a single Aib-residue in a peptaibol with (R)- and (S)-trifluoromethylalanine yields two local orientational constraints theta by solid state (19)F NMR. The structure of the membrane-perturbing antibiotic alamethicin in DMPC bilayers was analyzed in terms of two angles tau and rho from six such constraints, showing that the N-terminus (up to a kink at Pro14) is folded as an alpha-helix, tilted away from the membrane normal by 8 degrees, and assembled as an oligomer. The new (19)F NMR label CF(3)-Ala has thus been demonstrated to be highly sensitive, virtually unperturbing, and ideally suited to characterize peptaibols in membranes

	19877579, he heparin binding motif of endostatin mediates its interaction with receptor nucleolin.Endostatin is a potent angiogenesis inhibitor with heparin-dependent activities. Nucleolin, a novel functional receptor of endostatin, mediates both the internalization to endothelial cells and the antiangiogenic activity of endostatin. To define the exact role of the heparin binding motif in mediating the interaction between endostatin and its receptor nucleolin, up to six arginine residues (R155, R158, R184, R270, R193, and R194) located in the heparin binding motif of endostatin were substituted by alanine to make double, quadruple, or hexad point mutations, respectively. Contributions of the heparin binding motif to both the interaction with nucleolin and the biological activities of endostatin were investigated from in vitro to in vivo. Here we show that Arg to Ala point mutagenesis of the heparin binding motif does not interrupt the folding of endostatin but significantly impairs the interaction between endostatin and nucleolin. Double and quadruple mutants showed significantly decreased internalization to endothelial cells and antitumor activities, while the hexad Arg to Ala mutant completely lost its interaction with nucleolin and biological functions. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that the arginine clusters in the heparin binding motif of endostatin significantly contribute to its interaction with receptor nucleolin and mediate the antiangiogenic and antitumor activities of endostatin

	19883076, inetic analysis of cysteine desulfurase CD0387 from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803: formation of the persulfide intermediate.Stopped-flow absorption and isotope effect experiments have been used to dissect the mechanism of formation of the enzyme cysteinyl persulfide intermediate in the reaction of a cysteine desulfurase (CD), CD0387 from Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803. Seven accumulating intermediates have been identified and tentatively mapped onto the CD chemical mechanism originally proposed by Dean, White, and co-workers [Zheng, L., White, R. H., Cash, V. L., and Dean, D. R. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 4714-4720]. The first intermediate with lambda(max) approximately 350 nm is assigned as either a gem-diamine complex or a thiol adduct formed by nucleophilic attack of either the amine group or the sulfhydryl group of the substrate on the internal aldimine form of the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) cofactor. The second intermediate, with absorption features at approximately 417 and approximately 340 nm, is assigned as Cys aldimine and Cys ketimine forms in rapid equilibrium. In agreement with this assignment, a significant substrate alpha-deuterium equilibrium isotope effect ((2)H-EIE) favoring the aldimine form (417 nm) is observed in the second state produced in either wild-type CD0387 or the inactive C326A variant protein, which lacks the nucleophilic cysteine residue and is thus unable to proceed beyond this state unless  rescued  by a high concentration of an exogenous thiol. The third intermediate has an additional approximately 506 nm feature, characteristic of a quinonoid form, along with the features of the previous state. Its assignment as Ala aldimine, quinonoid, and ketimine forms in rapid equilibrium, which associates its formation with C-S bond cleavage and persulfide formation, is supported by its failure to develop in the C326A variant and the normal kinetic isotope effect ((2)H-KIE) on its formation, which is similar in magnitude to the (2)H-EIE disfavoring Cys-ketimine (from which the third state forms) in the second state. Decay of the Ala quinonoid absorption is tentatively attributed to a conformational change by the enzyme that disfavors this form in its equilibrium with Ala aldimine and Ala ketimine. Subsequent decay of the ketimine absorption ( approximately 340 nm) is attributed to release of Ala from the cofactor with an observed rate constant of 10 s(-1), the slowest step in the persulfide-forming half-reaction. The enzyme-persulfide.Ala complex dissociates rapidly with a K(d) of 98 mM. The final state with lambda(max) approximately 350 nm is assigned as a dead-end complex between the enzyme-persulfide and a second l-cysteine, which adds to the cofactor via its sulfhydryl group, possibly forming a cyclic thiazolidine species

	19884027, inetic modeling of hyperpolarized 13C1-pyruvate metabolism in normal rats and TRAMP mice.PURPOSE: To investigate metabolic exchange between (13)C(1)-pyruvate, (13)C(1)-lactate, and (13)C(1)-alanine in pre-clinical model systems using kinetic modeling of dynamic hyperpolarized (13)C spectroscopic data and to examine the relationship between fitted parameters and dose-response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dynamic (13)C spectroscopy data were acquired in normal rats, wild type mice, and mice with transgenic prostate tumors (TRAMP) either within a single slice or using a one-dimensional echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (1D-EPSI) encoding technique. Rate constants were estimated by fitting a set of exponential equations to the dynamic data. Variations in fitted parameters were used to determine model robustness in 15 mm slices centered on normal rat kidneys. Parameter values were used to investigate differences in metabolism between and within TRAMP and wild type mice. RESULTS: The kinetic model was shown here to be robust when fitting data from a rat given similar doses. In normal rats, Michaelis-Menten kinetics were able to describe the dose-response of the fitted exchange rate constants with a 13.65% and 16.75% scaled fitting error (SFE) for k(pyr--&gt;lac) and k(pyr--&gt;ala), respectively. In TRAMP mice, k(pyr--&gt;lac) increased an average of 94% after up to 23 days of disease progression, whether the mice were untreated or treated with casodex. Parameters estimated from dynamic (13)C 1D-EPSI data were able to differentiate anatomical structures within both wild type and TRAMP mice. CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic parameters estimated using this approach may be useful for in vivo monitoring of tumor progression and treatment efficacy, as well as to distinguish between various tissues based on metabolic activity

	19884265, ytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 Ala17 polymorphism is a genetic marker of autoimmune adrenal insufficiency: Italian association study and meta-analysis of European studies.OBJECTIVE: Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA4) gene polymorphism has been associated with human autoimmune diseases, but discordant data are available on its association with autoimmune Addison's disease (AAD). We tested the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-independent association of CTLA4+49 (A/G) (Ala 17) and/or CTLA4 CT60 (A/G) polymorphism with AAD. DESIGN: DNA samples from 180 AAD patients and 394 healthy control subjects from continental Italy were analyzed, and association statistical analyses and meta-analysis of published studies were performed. Methods TaqMan minor groove binder chemistry assays and PCR fragment length polymorphism assays were used. RESULTS: Frequency of allele G of CTLA4+49 was significantly increased among AAD patients (40% alleles) than among healthy controls (27% alleles; P&lt;0.0001). CTLA4 CT60 polymorphism was associated with AAD only in the heterozygous A/G individuals. The frequency of +49 AG+GG genotypes was significantly higher among AAD patients than among healthy control subjects, in both a co-dominant (P&lt;0.0001) and G dominant model (P&lt;0.0001). CTLA4+49 allele G was significantly associated with disease risk in both patients with isolated AAD and in patients with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that CTLA4+49 allele G was positively associated with AAD (P&lt;0.0001, odds ratio (OR)=2.43, 95% confidence interval=1.54-3.86) also after correction for DRB1*03-DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201, DRB1*04-DQA1*0301-DQB1*0302, and sex. Meta-analysis of five studies revealed a significant association of CTLA4+49 allele G with AAD (P&lt;0.0001) with an overall OR of 1.48 (1.28-1.71). CONCLUSIONS: The CTLA4+49 polymorphism is strongly associated with genetic risk for AAD, independently from the well-known association with HLA class II genes

	19900509,  new beta-chain haemoglobin variant with increased oxygen affinity: Hb Roma [beta115(g17)Ala--&gt;Val].BACKGROUND: Haemoglobin Roma [beta115(G17)Ala--&gt;Val] is a new adult haemoglobin variant found in a patient presenting a mild hypochromia and microcytosis. We studied this previously uncharacterised variant in order to evaluate the effect on the structural and funcional properties of the Ala--&gt;Val substitution at the alpha1beta1 interface. METHODS AND RESULTS: The variant chain was identified by direct DNA sequencing of the beta-globin gene, which revealed a GCC--&gt;GTC mutation in codon 115. This mutation was confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis of the tetramers and peptides. The oxygen-binding properties of the haemoglobin A/haemoglobin Roma mixture, in which the variant makes up 25% of the haemoglobins, showed a significant increase in oxygen affinity with respect to normal haemoglobin A, both in the absence and presence of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. The role of the betaG17 position, situated at the alpha(1)beta(1) interface, has been examined using computational models of haemoglobin Roma and other known betaG17 variants, in comparison with normal haemoglobin A. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the beta115(G17)Ala--&gt;Val substitution at the alpha1beta1 interface is responsible for increased oxygen affinity and mild destabilisation of the haemoglobin Roma. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: An amino acid substitution at the G17 position of the alpha1beta1 interface may result in stabilisation of the high affinity R-state of the haemoglobin molecule

	19903464, lock effect of capsaicin on hERG potassium currents is enhanced by S6 mutation at Y652.The objectives of this study were to investigate the inhibitory action of capsaicin on wild-type (WT) and mutation human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel currents (I(hERG)), and to determine whether mutations in the S6 region are significant for the inhibition of I(hERG) by capsaicin. The hERG channel (WT, Y652A and F656A) was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and studied using standard two-microelectrode voltage-clamp techniques. The results show that capsaicin blocks WT hERG in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC(50) of 17.45microM and a negative shift in the steady-state inactivation curve. Characteristics of blockade were consistent with capsaicin causing components of block in both the closed and open channel states. However, mutating the Y652 residue to Ala enhances the blockade effect of capsaicin with an IC(50) of 4.11microM, whereas mutation of F656A does not significantly alter drug potency. Simultaneously, for Y652A, the steady-state activation parameter is shifted to a more positive value by 5mV and the inactivation parameter is shifted to a more negative value by -29mV in the presence of 25microM capsaicin. In conclusion, capsaicin blocks hERG channels by binding to both the closed and open channel states.Y652 was important as a molecular determinant of blockade. Mutation Y652A enhances the drug block, which may cause some patients to be particularly sensitive to capsaicin clinically

	19903477, hangeability of individual domains of an aminoacyl-tRNA in polymerization by the ribosome.The changeabilities of individual modules of aminoacyl-tRNAs are poorly understood, despite the relevance for evolution, translational accuracy and incorporation of unnatural amino acids (AAs). Here, we dissect the effect of successive changes in four domains of Ala-tRNA(3)(Ala) on translation in a purified system. Incorporating five AAs, not one, was necessary to reveal major effects on yields of peptide products. Omitting tRNA modifications had little affect, but anticodon mutations were very inhibitory. Surprisingly, changing the terminal CCA to CdCA was sometimes inhibitory and non-cognate AAs were sometimes compensatory. Results have implications for translational fidelity and engineering

	19908203, dentification of a novel antitumor peptide based on the screening of an Ala-library derived from the LALF(32-51) region.Novel therapeutic peptides are increasingly making their way into clinical application. The cationic and amphipathic properties of certain peptides allow them to cross biological membranes in a non-disruptive way without apparent toxicity increasing drug bioavailability. By modifying the primary structure of the Limulus-derived LALF(32-51) peptide we designed a novel peptide, L-2, with antineoplastic effect and cell-penetrating capacity. Interestingly, L-2 induced cellular cytotoxicity in a variety of tumor cell lines and systemic injection into immunocompetent and nude mice bearing established solid tumor, resulted in substantial regression of the tumor mass and apoptosis. To isolate the gene transcripts specifically regulated by L-2 in tumor cells, we conducted suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) analysis and identified a set of genes involved in biological processes relevant to cancer biology. Our findings describe a novel peptide that modifies the gene expression of the tumor cells and exhibits antitumor effect in vivo, indicating that peptide L-2 is a potential candidate for anticancer therapy

	19924838, onformational effects of the non-natural alpha-methylserine on small peptides and glycopeptides.The synthesis and the conformational analysis in aqueous solution of a peptide and a glycopeptide containing the sequence threonine-alanine-alanine (Thr-Ala-Ala) are reported. Furthermore, the threonine residue has been replaced by the quaternary amino acid alpha-methylserine (MeSer) and their corresponding non-natural peptide and glycopeptide are also studied. The conformational analysis in aqueous solution combines NOEs and coupling constants data with Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations with time-averaged restraints. The study reveals that the beta-O-glycosylation produces a remarkable and completely different effect on the backbone of the peptide derived from Thr and MeSer. In the former, the beta-O-glycosylation is responsible for the experimentally observed shift from extended conformations (peptide) to folded ones (glycopeptide). In contrast, the beta-O-glycosylation of the MeSer-containing peptide, which clearly shows two main conformations in aqueous solution [extended ones (70%) and beta-turn (30%)], causes a high degree of flexibility for the backbone

	19948720, inding and orientation of tricyclic antidepressants within the central substrate site of the human serotonin transporter.Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have been used for decades, but their orientation within and molecular interactions with their primary target is yet unsettled. The recent finding of a TCA binding site in the extracellular vestibule of the bacterial leucine transporter 11 A above the central site has prompted debate about whether this vestibular site in the bacterial transporter is applicable to binding of antidepressants to their relevant physiological target, the human serotonin transporter (hSERT). We present an experimentally validated structural model of imipramine and analogous TCAs in the central substrate binding site of hSERT. Two possible binding modes were observed from induced fit docking calculations. We experimentally validated a single binding mode by combining mutagenesis of hSERT with uptake inhibition studies of different TCA analogs according to the paired mutation ligand analog complementation paradigm. Using this experimental method, we identify a salt bridge between the tertiary aliphatic amine and Asp(98). Furthermore, the 7-position of the imipramine ring is found vicinal to Phe(335), and the pocket lined by Ala(173) and Thr(439) is utilized by 3-substituents. These protein-ligand contact points unambiguously orient the TCA within the central binding site and reveal differences between substrate binding and inhibitor binding, giving important clues to the inhibition mechanism. Consonant with the well established competitive inhibition of uptake by TCAs, the resulting binding site for TCAs in hSERT is fully overlapping with the serotonin binding site in hSERT and dissimilar to the low affinity noncompetitive TCA site reported in the leucine transporter (LeuT)

	19954785, ontrol of impurities in L-aspartic acid and L-alanine by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a corona charged aerosol detector.In this study a reversed phase ion-pair high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method using charged aerosol detection (CAD) was developed and fully validated for the pharmaceutical quality control of L-aspartic acid (Asp). With a slight modification, the method also allows the evaluation of related substances in L-alanine (Ala). The method enables simultaneous control of related amino acids and of possibly occurring organic acids contaminants. A minimum limit of quantification of 0.03% could be achieved for all occurring related substances. Moreover, the detector sensitivity of the CAD was compared with an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD). Depending on the analyte the CAD was found to be 3.6-42 times more sensitive than the ELSD. The HPLC method was applied to the purity testing of 8 samples of pharmaceutical grade and reagent grade Asp and of 12 samples of Ala supplied by various manufacturers. Both substances were found to be of high purity (greater than 99.8% for Asp and greater than 99.9% for Ala). Malic acid and Ala were the major impurities in Asp. Asp and glutamic acid (Glu) were the only detectable impurities in Ala

	20000401, n-capillary derivatization and stacking electrophoretic analysis of gamma-aminobutyric acid and alanine in tea samples to redeem the detection after dilution to decrease matrix interference.An in-capillary derivatization and stacking capillary electrophoresis (CE) technique has been applied to redeem the detection of dilute analytes in the analysis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and alanine (Ala) in tea samples. Extracts from samples were diluted to eliminate matrix interference before introduction into the CE system. GABA and Ala in the diluted sample zone were derivatized with o-phthaldialdehyde/2-mercaptoethanol (OPA/2-ME) to form fluorescence-labeled products in the stacking process, and the labeled derivatives were then enriched by online stacking. Optimal conditions for the stacking, such as the concentration of the background buffer solution, the matrix of the sample zone (sample solution), and the volume of the sample injection, were investigated and then applied to real sample analysis. Under optimum conditions, the detections were linear in the range of 5.0 nM-2.5 microM with the square of correlation coefficients (R2) of 0.9995 and 0.9992 for GABA and Ala, respectively. Detection limits were found to be 0.7 and 0.8 nM for GABA and Ala, respectively. Tea samples were analyzed with recoveries between 92.33 and 97.87% and between 94.36 and 96.46% for GABA and Ala, respectively. This method is a rapid, convenient, and sensitive process for determining GABA and Ala in complicated matrix samples such as tea samples

	20010690, aradox of mistranslation of serine for alanine caused by AlaRS recognition dilemma.Mistranslation arising from confusion of serine for alanine by alanyl-tRNA synthetases (AlaRSs) has profound functional consequences. Throughout evolution, two editing checkpoints prevent disease-causing mistranslation from confusing glycine or serine for alanine at the active site of AlaRS. In both bacteria and mice, Ser poses a bigger challenge than Gly. One checkpoint is the AlaRS editing centre, and the other is from widely distributed AlaXps-free-standing, genome-encoded editing proteins that clear Ser-tRNA(Ala). The paradox of misincorporating both a smaller (glycine) and a larger (serine) amino acid suggests a deep conflict for nature-designed AlaRS. Here we show the chemical basis for this conflict. Nine crystal structures, together with kinetic and mutational analysis, provided snapshots of adenylate formation for each amino acid. An inherent dilemma is posed by constraints of a structural design that pins down the alpha-amino group of the bound amino acid by using an acidic residue. This design, dating back more than 3 billion years, creates a serendipitous interaction with the serine OH that is difficult to avoid. Apparently because no better architecture for the recognition of alanine could be found, the serine misactivation problem was solved through free-standing AlaXps, which appeared contemporaneously with early AlaRSs. The results reveal unconventional problems and solutions arising from the historical design of the protein synthesis machinery

	20034620, tructural characterization of teichoic acids from Lactobacillus brevis.Teichoic acids are a major constituent of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria. Structural characterization of lipoteichoic and teichoic acids isolated from Lactobacillus brevis was undertaken using 1D and 2D NMR experiments as well as chemical methodology. Compositional analysis indicated the presence of high amounts of glycerol, glucose, and alanine. In the case of LTA octadecenoic acid was also detected. The basic LTA/WTA structure was identified as 1,3-poly(glycerol phosphate) nonstoichiometrically substituted at C-2 of the glycerol residues with D-Ala or alpha-D-Glc. In the case of LTA a higher amount of Ala could be detected and partial alanylation at position C-6 of the Glc could also be observed

	20043997,  single amino acid residue, Ala 105, confers 16alpha-hydroxylase activity to human cytochrome P450 17alpha-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase.In adrenal steroidogenesis, CYP17 catalyses the 17alpha-hydroxylation of pregnenolone and progesterone and the subsequent 17,20-lyase reaction, yielding adrenal androgens. The enzyme exhibits distinctly different selectivities towards these substrates in various species. CYP17 has also been shown to exhibit 16alpha-hydroxylase activity towards progesterone in some species, with only human and chimp CYP17 catalysing the biosynthesis of substantial amounts of 16-OHprogesterone. The 16alpha-hydroxylase activity was investigated by introducing an Ala105Leu substitution into human CYP17. The converse mutation, Leu105Ala was introduced into the baboon, goat and pig enzymes. Wt human CYP17 converted approximately 30% progesterone to 16-OHprogesterone while the Ala105Leu mutant converted negligible amounts to 16-OHprogesterone ( approximately 9%), comparable to wt CYP17 of the other three species when expressed in COS-1 cells. The ratio of 17-hydroxylated products to 16-OHprogesterone of human CYP17 was 2.7 and that of the mutant human construct 10.5. Similar ratios were observed for human and goat CYP17 with the corresponding Ala or Leu residues. Although the Leu105Ala mutation of both baboon and pig CYP17 exhibited the same trend regarding the ratios, the rate of progesterone conversion was reduced. Coexpression with cytochrome b(5) significantly decreased the ratio of 17-hydroxylated products to 16-OHprogesterone in the Leu105 constructs, while effects were negligible with Ala at this position. Homology models show that Ala105 faces towards the active pocket in the predicted B'-C domain of CYP17. The smaller residue allows more flexibility of movement in the active pocket than Leu, presenting both the C16 and C17 of progesterone to the iron-oxy complex

	20048169, ntra- and interdomain effects due to mutation of calcium-binding sites in calmodulin.The IQ-motif protein PEP-19, binds to the C-domain of calmodulin (CaM) with significantly different k(on) and k(off) rates in the presence and absence of Ca(2+), which could play a role in defining the levels of free CaM during Ca(2+) transients. The initial goal of the current study was to determine whether Ca(2+) binding to sites III or IV in the C-domain of CaM was responsible for affecting the kinetics of binding PEP-19. EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding sites were selectively inactivated by the common strategy of changing Asp to Ala at the X-coordination position. Although Ca(2+) binding to both sites III and IV appeared necessary for native-like interactions with PEP-19, the data also indicated that the mutations caused undesirable structural alterations as evidenced by significant changes in amide chemical shifts for apoCaM. Mutations in the C-domain also affected chemical shifts in the unmodified N-domain, and altered the Ca(2+) binding properties of the N-domain. Conversion of Asp(93) to Ala caused the greatest structural perturbations, possibly due to the loss of stabilizing hydrogen bonds between the side chain of Asp(93) and backbone amides in apo loop III. Thus, although these mutations inhibit binding of Ca(2+), the mutated CaM may not be able to support potentially important native-like activity of the apoprotein. This should be taken into account when designing CaM mutants for expression in cell culture

	20052993, nvestigation of anticapsin biosynthesis reveals a four-enzyme pathway to tetrahydrotyrosine in Bacillus subtilis.Bacillus subtilis produces the antibiotic anticapsin as an L-Ala-L-anticapsin dipeptide precursor known as bacilysin, whose synthesis is encoded by the bacA-D genes and the adjacent ywfGH genes. To evaluate the biosynthesis of the epoxycyclohexanone amino acid anticapsin from the primary metabolite prephenate, we have overproduced, purified, and characterized the activity of the BacA, BacB, YwfH, and YwfG proteins. BacA is an unusual prephenate decarboxylase that avoids the typical aromatization of the cyclohexadienol ring by protonating C(8) to produce an isomerized structure. BacB then catalyzes an allylic isomerization, generating a conjugated dienone with a 295 nm chromophore. Both the BacA and BacB products are regioisomers of H(2)HPP (dihydro-4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate). The BacB product is then a substrate for the short chain reductase YwfH which catalyzes the conjugate addition of hydride at the C(4) olefinic terminus using NADH to yield the cyclohexenol-containing tetrahydro-4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate H(4)HPP. In turn, this keto acid is a substrate for YwfG, which promotes transamination (with L-Phe as amino donor), to form tetrahydrotyrosine (H(4)Tyr). Thus BacA, BacB, YwfH, and YwfG act in sequence in a four enzyme pathway to make H(4)Tyr, which has not previously been identified in B. subtilis but is a recognized building block in cyanobacterial nonribosomal peptides such as micropeptins and aeruginopeptins

	20059533, o-inheritance of Hb Hershey [beta70(E14) Ala--&gt;Gly] and Hb La Pommeraie [beta133(H11)Val--&gt;Met] in a Sicilian subject.OBJECTIVES: This report represents the first observation in Sicily of two rare beta-globin gene variants, Hb Hershey [beta70(E14) Ala--&gt;Gly] and Hb La Pommeraie [beta133(H11)Val--&gt;Met], found in a 35-year-old male patient from Messina, in the north-east of Sicily during population screening for hemoglobinopathies. METHODS: The occurrence of the Hb variants was assessed by cation exchange chromatography while complete blood counts were obtained using automatic cell counters. Red cell lysates were analyzed by electrophoresis at alkaline and acid pH. Stability of hemoglobin was checked by the isopropanol precipitation test and by the heat tests while inclusion bodies and reticulocyte count were determined by incubation of blood samples with brilliant cresyl blue. Molecular analysis was performed by DNA sequencing of beta- and alpha-globin genes. RESULTS: We observed an abnormally high performance liquid chromatography elution with a slight reduction in mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular haemoglobin parameters and mutations at codon 70 GCC--&gt;GGC (Hb Hershey) and at codon 133 GTG--&gt;ATG (Hb La Pommeraie) in beta-globin gene. CONCLUSION: Family analysis of three generations demonstrated the presence of these two mutations in trans. So it was possible to describe the phenotypes of these variants in a heterozygous state and in double heterozygous state

	20063889,  series of alpha-amino acid ester prodrugs of camptothecin: in vitro hydrolysis and A549 human lung carcinoma cell cytotoxicity.The objective of the present study was to identify a camptothecin (CPT) prodrug with optimal release and cytotoxicity properties for immobilization on a passively targeted microparticle delivery system. A series of alpha-amino acid ester prodrugs of CPT were synthesized, characterized, and evaluated. Four CPT prodrugs were synthesized with increasing aliphatic chain length (glycine (Gly) (2a), alanine (Ala) (2b), aminobutyric acid (Abu) (2c), and norvaline (Nva) (2d)). Prodrug reconversion was studied at pH 6.6, 7.0, and 7.4 corresponding to tumor, lung, and extracellular/physiological pH, respectively. Cytotoxicity was evaluated in A549 human lung carcinoma cells using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The hydrolytic reconversion rate to parent CPT increased with decreasing side chain length as well as increasing pH. The Hill slope of 2d was significantly less than CPT and the other prodrugs tested, indicating a higher cell death rate at lower concentrations. These results suggest that 2d is the best candidate for a passively targeted sustained release lung delivery system

	20065709, ensitivity comparison of two L-alanine doped blends to different photon energies.Blends of L-alanine (85% weight proportion) with KI (10%) and with PbI2 (10%), these last two compounds acting as dopants, and with PVA (5%) acting as binder, were prepared in water at 80 degrees C. A blend of pure L-alanine (95%) with PVA (5%) was also prepared. The three blends were irradiated with photon beams of different energies (120 kV, Co, and 10 MV) to a unique dose of 30 Gy to compare their sensitivities for those three energies. EPR spectra of the three irradiated blends were recorded in a K-Band spectrometer (24 GHz) taking aliquots of about 4 mg for each blend. The energy sensitivity of a blend was defined as the peak-to-peak amplitude of its EPR spectrum central line. For the Co energy (1.25 MeV) the blends presented practically the same sensitivity, indicating that the presence of the dopants does not affect the sensitivity of L-alanine. For 10 MV x-rays, there was an increment (around 10%-20%) in sensitivity for the two L-alanine doped blends compared with the pure L-alanine blend (not doped). In the case of 120 kV x-rays, the blends ala+KI and ala+PbI showed increments of 10 and 20 times more sensitivity than the pure L-alanine blend. It is concluded that the dopants KI and PbI2 produce a great enhancement of the L-alanine sensitivity to low-energy photons. For the same dopant's content (10%) in the blend, PbI2 showed a better performance. Increasing the PbI2 proportion (30%) in the blend allows the detection of radiation dose as low as 10 mGy for 120 kV x-rays. These results encourage the authors to try to enhance the sensitivity of L-alanine even more by increasing the dopant's content in the blend and diminishing the lower limit detection. Application of these L-alanine doped blends in the dosimetry in diagnostic radiology could be possible

	20091672, odel peptide-based system used for the investigation of metal ions binding to histidine-containing polypeptides.The reaction of histidine-containing polypeptides with toxic and essential metals and the molecular mechanism of complexation has yet to be determined, particularly with respect to the conformational changes of the interacting macromolecules. Therefore, a system of oligopeptides containing histidine residues in various positions of Ala or Gly sequences has been designed and used in heavy metal comparatively binding experiments. The role of spacing residues (Gly and Ala repeats) in selecting the various conformations was investigated. The newly synthesized peptides and metal ion adducts have been characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) as well as electrospray ion trap mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and circular dichroism (CD). The analysis of CD-spectra of the four peptides in water revealed that the secondary structure depends much on the position of each amino acid in the peptide backbone. Our peptides system reveals various binding mechanisms of metal ions to peptides depending on the position of histidine residue and the corresponding conformations of Ala or Gly sequences. Biological and medical consequences of conformational changes of metal-bound peptides are further discussed. Thus, the binding of heavy metals to four peptides may serve as a model system with respect to the conformational consequences of the metal addition on the amino acid repeats situated in prion protein

	20100277, elevance of conserved lysine and arginine residues in transmembrane helices for the transport activity of organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3) (SLCO1B3) mediates the uptake of endogenous substrates (e.g. estrone-3-sulphate) and drugs (e.g. pravastatin) from blood into hepatocytes. Structure-based modelling of OATP1B3 suggested that a pore with a positive electrostatic potential contributes to the transport mechanism. Therefore, we investigated the role of conserved positively charged amino acids for OATP1B3-mediated uptake of sulphobromophthalein (BSP) and pravastatin. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Residues Lys28, Lys41 and Arg580 in OATP1B3 were substituted by alanine, arginine, glutamine, glycine or lysine. Using immunofluorescence, immunoblot analysis and cellular uptake assays, the effect of these mutations on protein expression and transport activity was investigated. KEY RESULTS: Immunofluorescence revealed that all mutants were localized in the plasma membrane with partial intracellular retention of the Arg580&gt;Ala and Arg580&gt;Lys mutants. Lys41&gt;Ala, Lys41&gt;Gln, Lys41&gt;Gly, Arg580&gt;Gly and Arg580&gt;Lys showed significantly reduced transport for BSP and pravastatin. Kinetic analyses of BSP transport revealed a significant reduction of V(max) normalized to cell surface protein expression for Lys41&gt;Ala (wild type: 190 +/- 8, Lys41&gt;Ala:16 +/- 4 pmol (mg protein)(-1) min(-1), P &lt; 0.001), whereas V(max) of Lys41&gt;Arg and Arg580&gt;Lys (103 +/- 8 and 123 +/- 14 pmol (mg protein)(-1) min(-1), P &gt; 0.05) did not change significantly. This suggests that the positive charges at positions 41 and 580 are important for transport activity of BSP. Structural modelling indicated that the positively charged side chain of Lys41 is flexible within the pore. The orientation of Arg580 is defined by adjacent residues Glu74 and Asn77, which was confirmed by kinetic analysis of Glu74&gt;Ala. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We demonstrated that the conserved positively charged amino acids Lys41 and Arg580 are pivotal to the transport activity of OATP1B3

	20104847, ransport of the advanced glycation end products alanylpyrraline and pyrralylalanine by the human proton-coupled peptide transporter hPEPT1.The glycation compound pyrraline, which originates from the advanced Maillard reaction, appears in urine after consumption of pyrraline-containing food. We hypothesized that the absorption of pyrraline occurs in the form of dipeptides rather than the free amino acid. The human intestinal peptide transporter hPEPT1 was transiently expressed in HeLa cells. In hPEPT1-transfected cells but not in cells transfected with empty vector, the uptake of [(14)C]glycylsarcosine was strongly inhibited by alanylpyrraline (Ala-Pyrr) and pyrralylalanine (Pyrr-Ala). Free pyrraline did not inhibit peptide uptake. In Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing human PEPT1, both Ala-Pyrr and Pyrr-Ala generated significant inward directed currents. In a third approach, uptake of the dipeptides into hPEPT1-transfected HeLa cells was analyzed by HPLC. Ala-Pyrr and Pyrr-Ala were taken up by hPEPT1-expressing cells at a 4- to 7-fold higher rate than by HeLa cells transfected with the empty vector. We conclude that pyrraline containing dipeptides are transported by hPEPT1 in an electrogenic manner into intestinal cells

	20110468, -terminal acetylation of cellular proteins creates specific degradation signals.The retained N-terminal methionine (Met) residue of a nascent protein is often N-terminally acetylated (Nt-acetylated). Removal of N-terminal Met by Met-aminopeptidases frequently leads to Nt-acetylation of the resulting N-terminal alanine (Ala), valine (Val), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), and cysteine (Cys) residues. Although a majority of eukaryotic proteins (for example, more than 80% of human proteins) are cotranslationally Nt-acetylated, the function of this extensively studied modification is largely unknown. Using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we found that the Nt-acetylated Met residue could act as a degradation signal (degron), targeted by the Doa10 ubiquitin ligase. Moreover, Doa10 also recognized the Nt-acetylated Ala, Val, Ser, Thr, and Cys residues. Several examined proteins of diverse functions contained these N-terminal degrons, termed AcN-degrons, which are a prevalent class of degradation signals in cellular proteins

	20196828,  novel HLA-B allele, B*5535, was identified by sequence-based typing in a Chinese individual.A novel human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B allele, B*5535, has been identified in a Chinese individual by sequence-based typing, which has seven nucleotide changes from the closest matching allele B*5502 resulting in two amino acids changes: 69 Glu--&gt;Met; 70 Glu--&gt;Ala

	20204202, eplacement of Ala by Aib improves structuration and biological stability in thymine-based alpha-nucleopeptides.Three thymine-based nucleo-heptapeptides, each containing two nucleo-amino acids and zero, one or four Aib residues, respectively, have been synthesized. A single Aib residue is enough to promote the adoption of a helical structure in our nucleopeptides and to increase significantly their resistance towards enzymatic degradation. The insertion of four Aib residues, out of seven residues in the sequence, affords a rigid, 3(10)-helical nucleopeptide that is substantially unaffected by serum enzymes and is not cytotoxic

	20232870, natomy of a red copper center: spectroscopic identification and reactivity of the copper centers of Bacillus subtilis Sco and its Cys-to-Ala variants.Sco is a mononuclear red copper protein involved in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase. It is spectroscopically similar to red copper nitrosocyanin, but unlike the latter, which has one copper cysteine thiolate, the former has two. In addition to the two cysteine ligands (C45 and C49), the wild-type (WT) protein from Bacillus subtilis (hereafter named BSco) has a histidine (H135) and an unknown endogenous protein oxygen ligand in a distorted tetragonal array. We have compared the properties of the WT protein to variants in which each of the two coordinating Cys residues has been individually mutated to Ala, using UV/visible, Cu and S K-edge X-ray absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and resonance Raman spectroscopies. Unlike the Cu(II) form of native Sco, the Cu(II) complexes of the Cys variants are unstable. The copper center of C49A undergoes autoreduction to the Cu(I) form, which is shown by extended X-ray absorption fine structure to be composed of a novel two-coordinate center with one Cys and one His ligand. C45A rearranges to a new stable Cu(II) species coordinated by C49, H135 and a second His ligand recruited from a previously uncoordinated protein side chain. The different chemistry exhibited by the Cys variants can be rationalized by whether a stable Cu(I) species can be formed by autoredox chemistry. For C49A, the remaining Cys and His residues are trans, which facilitates the formation of the highly stable two-coordinate Cu(I) species, while for C45A such a configuration cannot be attained. Resonance Raman spectroscopy of the WT protein indicates a net weak Cu-S bond strength at approximately 2.24 A corresponding to the two thiolate-copper bonds, whereas the single variant C45A shows a moderately strong Cu-S bond at approximately 2.16 A. S K-edge data give a total covalency of 28% for both Cu-S bonds in the WT protein. These data suggest an average covalency per Cu-S bond lower than that observed for nitrosocyanin and close to that expected for type-2 Cu(II)-thiolate systems. The data are discussed relative to the unique Cu-S characteristics of cupredoxins, from which it is concluded that Sco does not contain highly covalent Cu-S bonds of the type expected for long-range electron-transfer reactivity

	20332332, ey proteolytic cleavage site and full-length form of DSPP.It is known that dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) is processed into NH(2)- and COOH-terminal fragments, but its key cleavage site has not been identified, nor has its full-length form been discovered. The objectives of this study were to identify the key cleavage site during DSPP processing and to search for full-length DSPP in vivo. We generated a construct encoding DSPP, in which Asp(452), a cleavage site residue, was replaced by Ala(452). The pulp-odontoblast complex and dentin were extracted, chromatographically separated, and assessed by Stains-All staining, Western immunoblotting, and mass spectrometry. These studies showed that the substitution of Asp(452) by Ala(452) completely blocks the cleavage of mouse DSPP in the transfected cells, indicating that the NH(2)-terminal peptide bond of Asp(452) is essential for the initiation of DSPP proteolytic processing. The results of this study revealed the presence of full-length DSPP and its processed fragments in extracts from the pulp/odontoblast and dentin

	20404340, ngineering thrombin for selective specificity toward protein C and PAR1.Thrombin elicits functional responses critical to blood homeostasis by interacting with diverse physiological substrates. Ala-scanning mutagenesis of 97 residues covering 53% of the solvent accessible surface area of the enzyme identifies Trp(215) as the single most important determinant of thrombin specificity. Saturation mutagenesis of Trp(215) produces constructs featuring k(cat)/K(m) values for the hydrolysis of fibrinogen, protease-activated receptor PAR1, and protein C that span five orders of magnitude. Importantly, the effect of Trp(215) replacement is context dependent. Mutant W215E is 10-fold more specific for protein C than fibrinogen and PAR1, which represents a striking shift in specificity relative to wild-type that is 100-fold more specific for fibrinogen and PAR1 than protein C. However, when the W215E mutation is combined with deletion of nine residues in the autolysis loop, which by itself shifts the specificity of the enzyme from fibrinogen and PAR1 to protein C, the resulting construct features significant activity only toward PAR1. These findings demonstrate that thrombin can be re-engineered for selective specificity toward protein C and PAR1. Mutations of Trp(215) provide important reagents for dissecting the multiple functional roles of thrombin in the blood and for clinical applications

	667349, Effect of deoxycytidine on the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges in human lymphocytes detected by using 5-bromdeoxyuridine]The frequency of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) was studied in cultivated blood lymphocytes of three normal individuals under elimination of DNA synthesis inhibiting action of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd 0.05 mM) with deoxycytidine (Cdr 0.1 and 0.01 mM). The frequency of SCE was significantly increased in the presence of 0.1 mM Cdr. In parallel with SCE frequency, Cdr elevated the percentage of metaphases of the second division. The increase of SCE in the presence of Cdr may be connected with normalization of the DNA replication under its action

	734768, Sister chromatid exchanges under bromine incorporation into DNA cytosine nucleotides. II. Utilization of 3H-deoxycytidine as a DNA cytosine precursor]The incorporation of 3H-deoxycytidine (3H-Cdr) in the presence of thymidine (Tdr) into cultured human blood lymphocytes has been studied. The analysis of the label in interphase nuclei as well as in chromosomes at metaphase was carried out. The labeling was much higher when 3H-Cdr (0.5 to 1.0 C/ml, 2--4 x 10(-5) mM) was added to the cultures simultaneously with Tdr (4 x 10(-1) mM). This observation is considered as an indication that in the presence of high doses of Tdr exogeneous Cdr is utilized to synthesize cytosine of DNA rather than thymidine. During the first hours after its addition, the bulk of 3H-Cdr is eliminated from the culture medium. At 12 hrs of the incubation, the medium seems to be free of the nucleoside as shown particularly from the single chromatid localization of the label in chromosomes of the second mitosis. The incorporation into lymphocytes of 3H-Tdr administered in the same dose under the same conditions was registered for the whole period of observation (24 hrs). The data obtained are discussed in relation to lymphocyte catabolism of exogeneous nucleosides

	10842056, ultiple functions of fibroblast growth factor-8 (FGF-8) in chick eye development.Fibroblast growth factor-8 (FGF-8) is an important signaling molecule in the generation and patterning of the midbrain, tooth, and limb. In this study we show that it is also involved in eye development. In the chick, Fgf-8 transcripts first appear in the distal optic vesicle when it contacts the head ectoderm. Subsequently Fgf-8 expression increases and becomes localized to the central area of the presumptive neural retina (NR) only. Application of FGF-8 has two main effects on the eye. First, it converts presumptive retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) into NR. This is apparent by the failure to express Bmp-7 and Mitf (a marker gene for the RPE) in the outer layer of the optic cup, coupled with the induction of NR genes, such as Rx, Sgx-1 and Fgf-8 itself. The induced retina displays the typical multilayered cytoarchitecture and expresses late neuronal differentiation markers such as synaptotagmin and islet-1. The second effect of FGF-8 exposure is the induction of both lens formation and lens fiber differentiation. This is apparent by the expression of a lens specific marker, L-Maf, and by morphological changes of lens cells. These results suggest that FGF-8 plays a role in the initiation and differentiation of neural retina and lens

	11255236, aculovirus-expressed vitamin D-binding protein-macrophage activating factor (DBP-maf) activates osteoclasts and binding of 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) does not influence this activity.Vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) is a multi-functional serum protein that is converted to vitamin D-binding protein-macrophage activating factor (DBP-maf) by post-translational modification. DBP-maf is a new cytokine that mediates bone resorption by activating osteoclasts, which are responsible for resorption of bone. Defective osteoclast activation leads to disorders like osteopetrosis, characterized by excessive accumulation of bone mass. Previous studies demonstrated that two nonallelic mutations in the rat with osteopetrosis have independent defects in the cascade involved in the conversion of DBP to DBP-maf. The skeletal defects associated with osteopetrosis are corrected in these mutants with in vivo DBP-maf treatment. This study evaluates the effects of various forms of DBP-maf (native, recombinant, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) bound) on osteoclast function in vitro in order to determine some of the structural requirements of this protein that relate to bone resorbing activities. Osteoclast activity was determined by evaluating pit formation using osteoclasts, isolated from the long bones of newborn rats, incubated on calcium phosphate coated, thin film, Ostologic MultiTest Slides. Incubation of osteoclasts with ex vivo generated native DBP-maf resulted in a dose dependent, statistically significant, activation of the osteoclasts. The activation was similar whether or not the vitamin D binding site of the DBP-maf was occupied. The level of activity in response to DBP-maf was greater than that elicited by optimal doses of other known stimulators (PTH and 1,25(OH(2)D(3)) of osteoclast function. Furthermore, another potent macrophage activating factor, interferon--gamma, had no effect on osteoclast activity. The activated form of a full length recombinant DBP, expressed in E. coli showed no activity in the in vitro assay. Contrary to this finding, baculovirus-expressed recombinant DBP-maf demonstrated significant osteoclast activating activity. The normal conversion of DBP to DBP-maf requires the selective removal of galactose and sialic acid from the third domain of the protein. Hence, the differential effects of the two recombinant forms of DBP-maf is most likely related to glycosylation; E. coli expressed recombinant DBP is non-glycosylated, whereas the baculovirus expressed form is glycosylated. These data support the essential role of glycosylation for the osteoclast activating property of DBP-maf

	11842109, -Maf, the gammaD-crystallin Maf-responsive element and growth factor regulation.The transcription factor c-Maf has been suggested to regulate the activity of gamma-crystallin promoters in lens fibre cells. We here show that the transactivation potential of c-Maf and MafB for the rat gammaD-crystallin Maf-responsive element (gammaD MARE) is dependent upon the cellular context and, using chimeric and single domain mutants, that c-Maf is most likely to be the cognate factor for the gammaD MARE in the lens. Transactivation of the gammaD MARE by c-Maf in lens cells was not enhanced by c-Fos or c-Jun and was not blocked by dominant negative c-Fos or c-Jun constructs. c-Maf can activate the gammaD MARE as a homodimer since activation of the gammaD-crystallin promoter in P19 embryonic carcinoma cells required only c-Maf, but none of a number of c-Fos and c-Jun family members tested. Transactivation by c-Maf was inhibited by activation of protein kinase A (PKA) (by signal transduction agonist forskolin) or of protein kinase C (PKC) (by signal transduction agonist tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate). Site-directed mutagenesis showed that this effect is not mediated by phosphorylation of the consensus PKA/PKC site in the extended DNA-binding domain, but likely involves activation of MAP kinase kinase, as inhibition by PD98059 increased transactivation by c-Maf

	12128206, -Maf, a downstream target of Pax6, is essential for chick lens development.During lens development in vertebrates, the orchestration of multiple transcriptional regulators is essential for fate determination and terminal differentiation. In early development, Pax6, Sox2 and Six3 are expressed in the head ectoderm, while L-maf, Prox1 and crystallin genes are expressed at a later stage in the lens placode in a more restricted fashion. To uncover the genetic interactions among these factors during lens development, we examined the effects of dominant-negative molecules of Pax6 and L-Maf, which play decisive roles in lens formation. The two dominant-negative isoforms of Pax6 repress L-maf, Prox1 and delta-crystallin expression, resulting in failure of lens formation. These effects of dominant-negative Pax6 are fully rescued by co-expression with wild-type L-Maf. In addition, dominant-negative L-Maf inhibits the expression of Prox1 and delta-crystallin, while misexpression of L-Maf causes ectopic induction of these genes in a Sox-2-dependent fashion. Our results demonstrate that L-Maf is a downstream target of Pax6 and mediates Pax6 activity in developing lens cells

	12659668, itamin D binding protein-macrophage activating factor (DBP-maf) inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth in mice.We have isolated a selectively deglycosylated form of vitamin D binding protein (DBP-maf) generated from systemically available DBP by a human pancreatic cancer cell line. DBP-maf is antiproliferative for endothelial cells and antiangiogenic in the chorioallantoic membrane assay. DBP-maf administered daily was able to potently inhibit the growth of human pancreatic cancer in immune compromised mice (T/C=0.09). At higher doses, DBP-maf caused tumor regression. Histological examination revealed that treated tumors had a higher number of infiltrating macrophages as well as reduced microvessel density, and increased levels of apoptosis relative to untreated tumors. Taken together, these data suggest that DBP-maf is an antiangiogenic molecule that can act directly on endothelium as well as stimulate macrophages to attack both the endothelial and tumor cell compartment of a growing malignancy

	12676323, ooperative action between L-Maf and Sox2 on delta-crystallin gene expression during chick lens development.Lens development is regulated by a variety of transcription factors with distinct properties. The lens-specific transcription factor, L-Maf, is essential for lens formation and induces lens-specific markers, such as the crystallin genes. In this study, we analyzed the mechanism by which L-Maf regulates delta-crystallin expression. Misexpression of L-Maf in the head ectoderm of lens placode-forming embryos by in ovo electroporation induced delta-crystallin only in the region surrounding the lens. To define this restricted expression, we misexpressed L-Maf together with other transcription factors implicated in delta-crystallin expression. Sox2 plus L-Maf expanded the delta-crystallin-inducible domain to the entire head ectoderm and simultaneously increased the quantity of delta-crystallin mRNA expressed. In contrast, co-expression of L-Maf with other factors such as Pax6, Six3 and Prox1 had little or no effect on delta-crystallin. We also observed that L-Maf and Sox2 cooperatively enhanced the transactivation of a reporter gene bearing the delta-crystallin enhancer in ovo, implying that L-Maf and Sox2 can induce delta-crystallin through the same enhancer. In conclusion, we report here that L-Maf and Sox2 cooperatively regulate the expression of delta-crystallin during chick lens development

	12938159, itogen-activated protein kinase pathway mediates DBP-maf-induced apoptosis in RAW 264.7 macrophages.Vitamin D-binding protein-macrophage-activating factor (DBP-maf) is derived from serum vitamin D binding protein (DBP) by selective deglycosylation during inflammation. In the present study, we investigated the effect of DBP-maf on RAW 264.7 macrophages and the underlying intracellular signal transduction pathways. DBP-maf increased proapoptotic caspase-3, -8, and -9 activities and induced apoptosis in RAW 264.7 cells. However, DBP, the precursor to DBP-maf did not induce apoptosis in these cells. Cell cycle analysis of DBP-maf-treated RAW 264.7 cells revealed growth arrest with accumulation of cells in sub-G(0)/G(1) phase. We also investigated the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in the DBP-maf-induced apoptosis of RAW264.7 cells. DBP-maf increased the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK1/2, while it decreased the ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Treatment with the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB202190, attenuated DBP-maf-induced apoptosis. PD98059, a MEK specific inhibitor, did not show a significant inhibition of apoptosis induced by DBP-maf. Taken together, these results suggest that the p38 MAPK pathway plays a crucial role in DBP-maf-mediated apoptosis of macrophages. Our studies indicate that, during inflammation DBP-maf may function positively by causing death of the macrophages when activated macrophages are no longer needed at the site of inflammation. In summary, we report for the first time that DBP-maf induces apoptosis in macrophages via p38 and JNK1/2 pathway

	15084979, ancreatic carcinogenesis: apoptosis and angiogenesis.Apoptosis and angiogenesis are critical biologic processes that are altered during carcinogenesis. Both apoptosis and angiogenesis may play an important role in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Despite numerous advances in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer, its prognosis remains dismal and a new therapeutic approach is much needed. Recent research has revealed that apoptosis and angiogenesis are closely interrelated. Several reports show that a tumor suppresser gene that is expressed in pancreatic carcinoma and related to malignant potential can induce apoptosis and also inhibit angiogenesis. At present, it is generally accepted that tumor growth in cancers, including pancreatic cancer, depends on angiogenesis. We have identified 2 new angiogenesis inhibitors from a conditioned medium of human pancreatic carcinoma cell line (BxPC-3): antiangiogenic antithrombin III (aaAT-III) and vitamin D binding protein-macrophage activating factor (DBP-maf). These molecules were able to regress tumors in severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) mice, demonstrating potent inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation. Moreover, the angiogenesis inhibitors induced tumor dormancy in the animal model. These results suggest that antiangiogenic therapy using angiogenesis inhibitors may become a new strategy for treatment of pancreatic cancer in the near future

	15261825, emporal expression of L-Maf and RaxL in developing chicken retina are arranged into mosaic pattern.Members of the maf gene family encode basic/leucine zipper transcription factors and play important roles during cell differentiation in vertebrate and Drosophila development. To investigate the possible roles of chicken lens-specific Maf (L-Maf)/MafA in retinal development, we analyzed its expression in the developing chicken retina. We first determined that L-Maf is expressed in a subset of ganglion cells, amacrine cells and rod cells during retinal development. To characterize further the L-Maf expressing cells during photoreceptor development, we compared the expression patterns of L-Maf and RaxL, a marker of cone cells. We found the L-Maf proteins are detectable from E10 between RaxL positive cone cells in outer nuclear layer (ONL). Subsequently, the expression of L-Maf is restricted to the innermost nuclear cells in the ONL during rod differentiation. In contrast, RaxL positive cone cells are distributed in the outermost layer of ONL. Furthermore, tangential retinal sections showed that L-Maf positive rods and RaxL positive cones form a mosaic pattern during photoreceptor development

	15759153, hylogenomic analysis and expression patterns of large Maf genes in Xenopus tropicalis provide new insights into the functional evolution of the gene family in osteichthyans.We have performed an exhaustive characterization of the large Maf family of basic leucine zipper transcription factors in vertebrates using the genome data available, and studied the embryonic expression patterns of the four paralogous genes thus identified in Xenopus tropicalis. Our phylogenetic analysis shows that, in osteichthyans, the large Maf family contains four orthology classes, MafA, MafB, c-Maf and Nrl, which have emerged in vertebrates prior to the split between actinopterygians and sarcopterygians. It leads to the unambiguous assignment of the Xenopus laevis XLmaf gene, previously considered a MafA orthologue, to the Nrl class, the identification of the amphibian MafA and c-Maf orthologues and the identification of the zebrafish Nrl gene. The four X. tropicalis paralogues display partially redundant but nevertheless distinct expression patterns in the somites, developing hindbrain, pronephros, ventral blood island and lens. Comparisons with the data available in the mouse, chick and zebrafish show that these large Maf expression territories are highly conserved among osteichthyans but also highlight a number of differences in the timing of large Maf gene expression, the precise extent of some labelled territories and the combinations of paralogues transcribed in some organs. In particular, the availability of robust phylogenies leads to a reinterpretation of previous expression pattern comparisons, suggesting an important part for function shuffling within the gene family in the developing lens. These data highlight the importance of exhaustive characterizations of gene families for comparative analyses of the genetic mechanisms, which control developmental processes in vertebrates

	15855760, he involvement of neural retina pax6 in lens fiber differentiation.Proper eye formation depends on specific interactions between neural and ectodermal tissues coupled with temporally distinct gene expression and a regulated sequence of signaling events. The homeobox gene Pax6 is vitally important to the entire process of eye development in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Pax6 expression for the retina anlage has been shown to be indispensable in the development of various retinal cells. Here, we report that Pax6 expression in neural tissue plays an important role in lens development. Expression of a dominant-negative version of Pax6 isoform that lacks 5a-exon sequence in developing optic vesicles (OV) of chick embryos led to arrest of lens development at the lens vesicle stage as well as optic cup deformation. To gain insights into the molecular events underlying deformed lens formation, we examined the expression of several transcription factors in the lens of Pax6-negative-OV eye. Importantly, L-Maf was downregulated while c-Maf was found normal in deformed lens. We detected a downregulation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF8) in the neural tissue. Our in vivo experiments suggest that Pax6 in neural retina regulates FGF8 expression, which may maintain L-Maf expression in the lens to be essential for later lens fiber differentiation

	15921496, GF19-FGFR4 signaling elaborates lens induction with the FGF8-L-Maf cascade in the chick embryo.The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family is known to be involved in vertebrate eye development. However, distinct roles of individual FGF members during eye development remain largely elusive. Here, we show a detailed expression pattern of Fgf19 in chick lens development. Fgf19 expression initiated in the forebrain, and then became restricted to the distal portion of the optic vesicle abutting the future lens placode, where FGF receptor 4 (Fgfr4), a receptor for FGF19, was expressed. Fgf8, a positive regulator for L-Maf, was expressed in a portion of the optic vesicle. To examine the role of FGF19 signaling during early eye development, Fgf19 was misexpressed near the presumptive lens ectoderm; however, no alteration in the expression of lens marker genes was observed. Conversely, a secreted form of FGFR4 was misexpressed to inhibit an FGF19 signal, resulting in the induction of L-Maf expression. To further define the relationship between L-Maf and Fgf19, L-Maf misexpression was performed, resulting in ectopic induction of Fgf19 expression by Hamburger and Hamilton's stage 12/13. Furthermore, misexpression of Fgf8 induced Fgf19 expression in addition to L-Maf. These results suggest that FGF19-FGFR4 signaling plays a role in early lens development in collaboration with FGF8 signaling and L-Maf transcriptional system

	15972792, he 5'-AT-rich half-site of Maf recognition element: a functional target for bZIP transcription factor Maf.The Maf family of proteins are a subgroup of basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors, which recognize a long palindromic DNA sequence [TGCTGAC(G)TCAGCA] known as the Maf recognition element (MARE). Interestingly, the functional target enhancer sequences present in the alphaA-crystallin gene contain a well-conserved half-site of MARE rather than the entire palindromic sequence. To resolve how Maf proteins bind to target sequences containing only MARE half-sites, we examined their binding activities using electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays as well as in vitro and in vivo reporter assays. Our results indicate that the 5'-flanking region of the MARE half-site is required for Maf proteins to bind both in vitro and in vivo. The critical 5'-flanking sequences for c-Maf were determined by a selection and amplification binding assay and show a preference for AT-rich nucleotides. Furthermore, sequence analysis of the regulatory regions of several target genes also suggests that AT-rich sequences are important. We conclude that Maf can bind to at least two types of target sequences, the classical MARE (palindrome type) and a 5'-AT-rich MARE half-site (half-site type). Our results provide important new insights into the DNA binding and site selection by bZIP transcription factors

	16324151, he superoxide-producing NAD(P)H oxidase Nox4 in the nucleus of human vascular endothelial cells.The superoxide-producing NAD(P)H oxidase Nox4 was initially identified as an enzyme that is highly expressed in the kidney and is possibly involved in oxygen sensing and cellular senescence. Although the oxidase is also abundant in vascular endothelial cells, its role remains to be elucidated. Here we show that Nox4 preferentially localizes to the nucleus of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), by immunocytochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy using three kinds of affinity-purified antibodies raised against distinct immunogens from human Nox4. Silencing of Nox4 by RNA interference (RNAi) abrogates nuclear signals given with the antibodies, confirming the nuclear localization of Nox4. The nuclear fraction of HUVECs exhibits an NAD(P)H-dependent superoxide-producing activity in a manner dependent on Nox4, which activity can be enhanced upon cell stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. This stimulant also facilitates gene expression as estimated in the present transfection assay of HUVECs using a reporter regulated by the Maf-recognition element MARE, a DNA sequence that constitutes a part of oxidative stress response. Both basal and stimulated transcriptional activities are impaired by RNAi-mediated Nox4 silencing. Thus Nox4 appears to produce superoxide in the nucleus of HUVECs, thereby regulating gene expression via a mechanism for oxidative stress response

	16400520, nhibition of angiogenesis by vitamin D-binding protein: characterization of anti-endothelial activity of DBP-maf.Angiogenesis is a complex process involving coordinated steps of endothelial cell activation, proliferation, migration, tube formation and capillary sprouting with participation of intracellular signaling pathways. Regulation of angiogenesis carries tremendous potential for cancer therapy. Our earlier studies showed that vitamin D-binding protein-macrophage activating factor (DBP-maf) acts as a potent anti-angiogenic factor and inhibits tumor growth in vivo. The goal of this investigation was to understand the effect of DBP-maf on human endothelial cell (HEC) and the mechanism of angiogenesis inhibition. DBP-maf inhibited human endothelial cell (HEC) proliferation by inhibiting DNA synthesis (IC(50) = 7.8 +/- 0.15 microg/ml). DBP-maf significantly induced S- and G0/G1-phase arrest in HEC in 72 h. DBP-maf potently blocked VEGF-induced migration, tube-formation of HEC in a dose dependent manner. In addition, DBP-maf inhibited growth factor-induced microvessel sprouting in rat aortic ring assay. Moreover, DBP-maf inhibited VEGF signaling by decreasing VEGF-mediated phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and ERK1/2, a downstream target of VEGF signaling cascade. However, Akt activation was not affected. These studies collectively demonstrate that DBP-maf inhibits angiogenesis by blocking critical steps such as HEC proliferation, migration, tube formation and microvessel sprouting. DBP-maf exerts its effect by inhibiting VEGR-2 and ERK1/2 signaling cascades. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of anti-endothelial activity of DBP-maf will allow us to develop it as an angiogenesis targeting novel drug for tumor therapy

	16487043, he heme-Bach1 pathway in the regulation of oxidative stress response and erythroid differentiation.Heme--as a prosthetic group of proteins required for oxygen transport and storage, respiration, and biosynthetic pathways--is essential for practically all forms of life. Additionally, the degradation products of heme (i.e., carbon monoxide, biliverdin, and bilirubin) produced by the enzymatic actions of heme oxygenase (HO) and biliverdin reductase, possess various biological activities in vivo. In mammalian cells, heme also functions as an intracellular regulator of gene expression by virtue of its ability to bind to Bach1, a transcription factor that functions in association with small Maf proteins. Normally, such complexes function as repressors by binding to specific target sequences, the Maf recognition element (MARE), within enhancers of genes encoding proteins such as HO-1 and beta-globin. By binding to Bach1, heme induces selective removal of the repressor from the gene enhancers permitting subsequent occupancy of the MAREs by activators that, interestingly, also contain small Maf proteins. Thus small Maf proteins play dual functions in gene expression: complexes with Bach1 repress MARE-dependent gene expression, whereas heterodimers with NF-E2 p45 or related factors (Nrf1, Nrf2, and Nrf3) activate MARE-driven genes. By modulating the equilibrium of the small Maf heterodimer network, heme regulates expression of the cytoprotective enzyme HO-1 during the stress response and of beta-globin during erythroid differentiation. Implications of such heme-regulated gene expression in human diseases including atherosclerosis are discussed

	17129360, arcinogenesis and transcriptional regulation through Maf recognition elements.Many studies on carcinogenesis carried out early in the last century are united on the consensus that cancer is a genetic disease. Cancer cells typically display gene dysfunction and endogenous or exogenous insults resulting in gene dysfunction are often carcinogenic. Recent advances in stem cell biology added the new concept that cancer originates from a single cancer-initiating cell. To understand the molecular basis of carcinogenesis from the beginning to the full acquirement of malignancy, factors concerned with carcinogenesis were categorized into three groups: those guarding and stabilizing genomes, those regulating cell proliferation, and those conferring resistance to various micro-environmental stresses. One example of particular interest is the Keap1-Nrf2 system since, according to recent studies, it has turned out to be ambivalent. Nrf2 heterodimerizes with small Maf protein to strongly activate transcription through the Maf recognition element (MARE) and Keap1 is an inhibitory regulator of Nrf2. The genes regulated by Nrf2 are very important for cellular protection of the genome from xenobiotic and oxidative stresses and, consequently, for preventing carcinogenesis. This implies that enhancing Nrf2 activity is a promising method for thwarting cancer. On the contrary, the constitutive activation of Nrf2 due to mutations in the keap1 gene is characteristically observed in lung cancer cells, suggesting that induced expression of Nrf2 target genes favors the prevalence of cancer cells

	17262012, equential and combinatorial roles of maf family genes define proper lens development.PURPOSE: Maf proteins have been shown to play pivotal roles in lens development in vertebrates. The developing chick lens expresses at least three large Maf proteins. However, the transcriptional relationship among the three large maf genes and their various roles in transactivating the downstream genes largely remain to be elucidated. METHODS: Chick embryos were electroporated with wild-type L-maf, c-maf, and mafB by in ovo electroporation, and their effects on gene expression were determined by in situ hybridization using specific probes or by immunostaining. Endogenous gene expression was determined using nonelectroporated samples. RESULTS: A regulation mechanism exists among the members of maf family gene. An early-expressed member of this gene family typically stimulates the expression of later-expressed members. We also examined the regulation of various lens-expressing genes with a focus on the interaction between different Maf proteins. We found that the transcriptional ability of Maf proteins varies, even when the target is the same, in parallel with their discrete functions. L-Maf and c-Maf have no effect on E-cadherin expression, whereas MafB enhances its expression and thereby impedes lens vesicle formation. This study also revealed that Maf proteins can regulate the expression of gap junction genes, connexins, and their interacting partner, major intrinsic protein (MIP), during lens development. Misexpression of L-Maf and c-Maf induces ectopic expression of Cx43 and MIP; in contrast, MafB appears to have no effect on Cx43, but induces MIP significantly as evidenced from our gain-of-function experiments. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that large Maf function is indispensable for chick lens initiation and development. In addition, L-Maf positively regulates most of the essential genes in this program and directs a series of molecular events leading to proper formation of the lens

	17428264, -Maf regulates p27kip1 expression during chick lens fiber differentiation.Organ formation requires spatio-temporal proliferation and differentiation of precursor cells. During lens development, placodal cells in the posterior lens vesicle exit from the cell cycle and enter into the process of differentiation. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors play critical roles in cell cycle exit and promote differentiation in several tissues. We have found that p27kip1 is expressed in the posterior lens cells that undergo differentiation to form the differentiated fiber cells. The transcription factor L-Maf is expressed in these cells earlier than p27kip1. From in ovo gain- or loss-of-function experiments, we have found that L-Maf can, respectively, induce or inhibit the expression of p27kip1 in lens cells. Promoter assays using the 5' upstream sequences of the human p27kip1 gene indicate that L-Maf can activate p27kip1 transcription through the basal regulatory region. We suggest that L-Maf regulates cell cycle exit of the posterior lens cells by activating p27kip1, and thus directs fiber cell differentiation during lens formation in chick

	17569705, ultiple mechanisms and functions of maf transcription factors in the regulation of tissue-specific genes.Maf family transcription factors are regulators of tissue-specific gene expression and cell-differentiation in a wide variety of tissues and are also involved in human diseases and oncogenic transformation. To establish tissue-specific expression, Maf binds to Maf-recognition elements (MAREs) in the regulatory regions of target genes, and functionally interacts with other transcription factors. For example, L-Maf and c-Maf, which are specifically expressed in developing lens cells, act synergistically with Sox proteins to induce lens-specific crystalline genes. MafA, a beta-cell-specific member of the Maf family, activates the insulin gene promoter synergistically with Pdx1 and Beta2 to establish beta-cell specific expression. Furthermore, in beta-cells, MafA activity is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels by glucose and oxidative stress. This review summarizes the functions and roles of Maf in various biological processes and recent progress in elucidating the mechanisms whereby Maf proteins regulate transcription

	18201722, mall Maf proteins in mammalian gene control: mere dimerization partners or dynamic transcriptional regulators?The small Maf basic leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins MafF, MafG and MafK, while modest in size, have emerged as crucial regulators of mammalian gene expression. Intriguingly, small Mafs do not contain an obvious transcriptional activation domain. However, previously perceived as  mere  partner molecules conferring DNA binding specificity to complexes with larger bZIP proteins, such as the CNC family member Nrf2, it has become clear that small Maf proteins are essential and dynamically regulated transcription factors. Current data suggest stringent control of small Maf protein function through transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms. Initial gene targeting experiments revealed considerable functional redundancy among small Maf proteins in vivo. This was not unexpected, due to the high level of homology among the three small Mafs. Nevertheless, further studies showed that these transcription factors have critical roles in various cellular processes, including stress signaling, hematopoiesis, CNS function and oncogenesis. Recent data provide a possible link between small Maf-mediated transcription and the inflammatory response

	19821532, uclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 is a positive regulator of human bile salt export pump expression.The bile salt export pump (BSEP) is the major determinant of bile salt-dependent bile secretion, and its deficiency leads to cholestatic liver injury. BSEP/Bsep gene expression is regulated by the nuclear farnesoid X receptor. However, BSEP expression, though reduced, is retained in the livers of Fxr(-/-) mice, indicating that additional transcriptional factors may regulate its expression. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) plays a major role in response to oxidative stress by binding to antioxidant-responsive elements that regulate many hepatic phase I and II enzymes as well as hepatic efflux transporters. Computer software analysis of human BSEP reveals two musculo-aponeurotic fibrosacroma (Maf) recognition elements (MAREs) from the sequence in the proximal promoter region where Nrf2 may bind. In this study, we assessed whether Nrf2 plays a role in human BSEP expression and if this might be mediated by MAREs. Oltipraz, a potent activator of Nrf2, increased BSEP messenger RNA expression by approximately seven-fold in HepG2 cells and protein by approximately 70% in human hepatocytes. Small interfering RNAs lowered NRF2 expression in HepG2 cells and prevented the up-regulation of BSEP by oltipraz. Human BSEP promoter activity was stimulated by Nrf2 in a dose-dependent manner in luciferase reporter assays. Mutations of the predicted MARE1, but not MARE2, abolished this Nrf2 transcriptional activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays also demonstrated that Nrf2 specifically bound to MARE1, but not MARE2 regions in the BSEP promoter in HepG2 cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays further demonstrated direct binding of MARE1 in the BSEP promoter. CONCLUSION: Nrf2 is a positive transcriptional regulator of human BSEP expression. Pharmacological activation of Nrf2 may be beneficial for cholestatic liver injury

	9525857, nduction of lens differentiation by activation of a bZIP transcription factor, L-Maf.After the vertebrate lens is induced from head ectoderm, lens-specific genes are expressed. Transcriptional regulation of the lens-specific alphaA-crystallin gene is controlled by an enhancer element, alphaCE2. A gene encoding an alphaCE2-binding protein, L-maf(lens-specific maf), was isolated. L-maf expression is initiated in the lens placode and is restricted to lens cells. The gene product L-Maf regulates the expression of multiple genes expressed in the lens, and ectopic expression of this transcription factor converts chick embryonic ectodermal cells and cultured cells into lens fibers. Thus, vertebrate lens induction and differentiation can be triggered by the activation of L-Maf

	9528779, ens-specific gene recruitment of zeta-crystallin through Pax6, Nrl-Maf, and brain suppressor sites.Zeta-Crystallin is a taxon-specific crystallin, an enzyme which has undergone direct gene recruitment as a structural component of the guinea pig lens through a Pax6-dependent mechanism. Tissue specificity arises through a combination of effects involving three sites in the lens promoter. The Pax6 site (ZPE) itself shows specificity for an isoform of Pax6 preferentially expressed in lens cells. High-level expression of the promoter requires a second site, identical to an alphaCE2 site or half Maf response element (MARE), adjacent to the Pax6 site. A promoter fragment containing Pax6 and MARE sites gives lens-preferred induction of a heterologous promoter. Complexes binding the MARE in lens nuclear extracts are antigenically related to Nrl, and cotransfection with Nrl elevates zeta-crystallin promoter activity in lens cells. A truncated zeta promoter containing Nrl-MARE and Pax6 sites has a high level of expression in lens cells in transgenic mice but is also active in the brain. Suppression of the promoter in the brain requires sequences between -498 and -385, and a site in this region forms specific complexes in brain extract. A three-level model for lens-specific Pax6-dependent expression and gene recruitment is suggested: (i) binding of a specific isoform of Pax6; (ii) augmentation of expression through binding of Nrl or a related factor; and (iii) suppression of promoter activity in the central nervous system by an upstream negative element in the brain but not in the lens

	10321623, acial orf.Orf is an occupational dermatosis caused by a poxvirus that infects sheep or goats. Human transmission typically occurs in people in contact with the infected animals or by handling contaminated animal products such as wool or meat. The infection in humans is classically characterized by a solitary papule on the fingers or hands. Involvement of the face or head has rarely been reported. We report orf in a young woman with multiple nodules on the face

This paper reports the prevalence, incidence and risk factors associated with the infection in a cohort of farmworkers from three areas of England, derived from the results of self-reporting and serology. Twenty-three per cent of those employed or living on a sheep farm reported ever having had orf, and the antibody serological profiles indicated a prevalence of 4 per cent and an annual incidence of 2.8 per cen. The main risk factors associated with the infection were contact with sheep, the size of the sheep flock, and contact with dogs

The dually infected animals differed from the controls in showing skin lesions of greater severity, prolonged viral shedding, and lower antibody titres. Infection with E. phagocytophila had no significant effect on virus-specific lymphocyte proliferation. Such proliferation was detected in the peripheral blood of all lambs as early as 7 days after exposure to orf virus

	10614496, mmunomodulation by virulence proteins of the parapoxvirus orf virus.Three orf virus putative virulence proteins are described that exhibit immunomodulatory functions. The OVIFNR gene at the left terminus of the viral genome encodes an interferon resistance protein with homology to the E3L gene of vaccinia virus. OVIFNR functions by preventing a dsRNA-dependent kinase from inhibiting virus and cell protein synthesis as part of the interferon-induced anti-viral state within infected cells. The orf virus orthologue of the ovine interleukin-10 (vIL-10) gene is located at the right terminus of the viral genome. Both vIL-10 and host (ovine) IL-10 function in vitro as inhibitors of pro-inflammatory cytokine production by keratinocytes and macrophages, and both inhibit IFN-gamma production from activated peripheral blood lymphocytes. Both the orf virus vIL-10 and ovine IL-10 stimulate mast cell and thymocyte proliferation. In this respect the orf virus IL-10 differs from Epstein Barr virus IL-10 which does not exhibit cell proliferative activity. Finally, the orf virus GM-CSF inhibitory factor gene (GIF) at the right terminus of the viral genome encodes an inhibitor of GM-CSF that also binds IL-2. Together, these viral proteins are capable of inhibiting key components of the ovine anti-virus immune and inflammatory response

	10627542, e>Orf virus encodes a novel secreted protein inhibitor of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-2.The parapoxvirus orf virus encodes a novel soluble protein inhibitor of ovine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-2 (IL-2). The GM-CSF- and IL-2-inhibitory factor (GIF) gene was expressed as an intermediate-late viral gene in orf virus-infected cells. GIF formed homodimers and tetramers in solution, and it bound ovine GM-CSF with a K(d) of 369 pM and ovine IL-2 with a K(d) of 1.04 nM. GIF did not bind human GM-CSF or IL-2 in spite of the fact that orf virus is a human pathogen. GIF was detected in afferent lymph plasma draining the skin site of orf virus reinfection and was associated with reduced levels of lymph GM-CSF. GIF expression by orf virus indicates that GM-CSF and IL-2 are important in host antiviral immunity

	10781724, olecular characterization of Brazilian isolates of orf virus.Outbreaks of an epidermic disease suggesting parapox virus infections have been observed in all major herds of sheep and goats from different geographical areas of Brazil. Clinical samples (dried scabs) were collected and orf virus was isolated and characterized by electron microscopy in previous work. In order to characterize these viruses at the molecular level, a modified methodology for genomic DNA extraction directly from scabs was used and such DNA was used to derive the restriction enzyme digestion patterns for clinical samples from three distinct geographic origins. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis was used to separate restriction enzyme DNA fragments and heterogeneity among isolates from different geographic areas could be observed on stained gels. The HindIII-G DNA fragment from orf-A virus genome was cloned and hybridized to DNA of other orf virus isolates. Further heterogeneity was confirmed by these hybridizations

	10802292, n vivo T-cell subset depletion suggests that CD4+ T-cells and a humoral immune response are important for the elimination of orf virus from the skin of sheep.In vivo lymphocyte subset depletion offers a unique opportunity to study the roles of different cellular components of the immune system of sheep during infection with orf virus. Lambs were depleted of specific lymphocyte subsets by the intravenous administration of monoclonal antibodies against ovine lymphocyte surface markers and then challenged with orf virus. The skin lesions that developed were scored visually as to their severity. Blood samples were collected to monitor the lymphocyte depletions and to measure orf-virus-specific antibody levels. Skin biopsies were collected from the lesion site and studied to determine the course of the infection and the presence of various cell types and orf virus. All the sheep developed orf virus lesions after infection. All three of the CD4-depleted lambs were unable to clear virus from their skin and did not have an antibody response to the virus. Virus was also detected in the skin of one each of the three CD8-depleted, WC1-depleted and control sheep on the final day of the trial. CD8(+) lymphocytes did not appear to be essential for viral clearance later in the infection. Depletion of the majority of gammadelta(+) T-cells did not affect the outcome of orf virus infection. In sheep with high orf-virus-specific antibody titres at the time of infection, orf lesions healed faster than lesions in sheep with low antibody levels, and this occurred regardless of the lymphocyte depletion status of the animals. This study suggests that the presence of CD4(+) T-cells and orf-virus-specific antibodies are important for the control of viral replication in the skin of infected sheep

	10844261, Human orf and erythema multiforme]BACKGROUND: Orf is a disease of sheep due to a parapoxvirus. Transmission in man is possible, and is generally benign, self-limited condition. Although, rare complications have been mentioned. We report a case of Orf with erythema multiforme in a young girl. CASE REPORT: A 13-year-old girl presented to our department with an erythema multiform. The cutaneous examination revealed painless erythematous nodule of her right index finger developed 15 days after a contact with a lamb. The diagnosis of Orf complicated by erythema multiforme was made on the basis of her typical history. Lesions heal with symptomatic therapy in 15 days. DISCUSSION: Orf presents in sheeps as a pustular dermatitis or a vesicular oral mucosal lesions, and in man as a single lesion on the site of infection. This lesion generally heals without complications, although secondary infection is not uncommon. Twenty one cases of erythema multiforme have been recorded following infection with the Orf virus. In typical cases, the diagnosis is established by a history of contact with infected animals and the appearance of the lesion. Electron microscopic examination can be helpful sometimes. Lesions regress in 4 to 5 weeks without specific treatment

	11022792, equence and functional analysis of a homolog of interleukin-10 encoded by the parapoxvirus orf virus.Orf virus is a large DNA virus and is the type species of the Parapoxvirus genus of the family Poxviridae. Orf virus infects the epithelium of sheep and goats and is transmissible to humans. Recently we discovered a gene in orf virus that encodes a polypeptide with remarkable homology to mammalian interleukin (IL-10) and viral encoded IL-10s of herpes viruses. The predicted polypeptide sequence shows high levels of amino acid identity to IL-10 of sheep (80%), cattle (75%), humans (67%) and mice (64%), as well as IL-10-like proteins of Epstein-Barr virus (63%) and equine herpes virus (67%). The C-terminal region, comprising two-thirds of the orf virus protein, is identical to ovine IL-10 which suggests that this gene has been captured from its host sheep during the evolution of orf virus. In contrast the N-terminal region shows little homology with cellular IL10s and in this respect resembles other viral IL-10s. IL-10 is a pleiotrophic cytokine that can exert either immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive effects on many cell types. IL-10 is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine with inhibitory effects on non-specific immunity in particular macrophage function and Thl effector function. Our studies so far, indicate, that the functional activities of orf virus IL-10 are the same as ovine IL-10. Orf virus IL-10 stimulates mouse thymocyte proliferation and inhibits cytokine synthesis in lipopolysaccharide-activated ovine macrophages, peripheral blood monocytes and keratinocytes. Infection of sheep with an IL-10 deletion mutant of orf virus has shown that interferon-gamma levels are higher in tissue infected with the mutant virus than the parent virus. The functional activities of IL-10 and our data on orf virus IL-10 suggest a role in immune evasion

	11044114, iral vascular endothelial growth factor plays a critical role in orf virus infection.Infection by the parapoxvirus orf virus causes proliferative skin lesions in which extensive capillary proliferation and dilation are prominent histological features. This infective phenotype may be linked to a unique virus-encoded factor, a distinctive new member of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of molecules. We constructed a recombinant orf virus in which the VEGF-like gene was disrupted and show that inactivation of this gene resulted in the loss of three VEGF activities expressed by the parent virus: mitogenesis of vascular endothelial cells, induction of vascular permeability, and activation of VEGF receptor 2. We used the recombinant orf virus to assess the contribution of the viral VEGF to the vascular response seen during orf virus infection of skin. Our results demonstrate that the viral VEGF, while recognizing a unique profile of the known VEGF receptors (receptor 2 and neuropilin 1), is able to stimulate a striking proliferation of blood vessels in the dermis underlying the site of infection. Furthermore, the data demonstrate that the viral VEGF participates in promoting a distinctive pattern of epidermal proliferation. Loss of a functional viral VEGF resulted in lesions with markedly reduced clinical indications of infection. However, viral replication in the early stages of infection was not impaired, and only at later times did it appear that replication of the recombinant virus might be reduced

	11468742,  case of human orf in an immunocompromised patient treated successfully with cidofovir cream.Immunocompromised patients may have severe forms of infections. Since there is an increasing number of patients maintained under immunosuppressive therapy, we will be confronted with increasing frequency with these infectious problems. Effective treatments will be of great value. The case is described of a renal transplant with a giant orf lesion, which continued growing instead of regressing spontaneously as is observed usually. The treatment options in such patients are limited. It was decided to treat the patient with the antiviral drug cidofovir (HPMPC, Vistide. Topical cidofovir treatment resulted in complete regression of the lesion. This case is discussed in the context of the known literature on orf (ecthyma contagiosum)

	11518992, Stay away from surgery: ecthyma contagiosum]15 patients with Orf's disease were evaluated. Seven out of 15 patients (Group 1) were treated surgically because of different diagnoses. Seven patients who were misdiagnosed and treated surgically (Group 1), and eight patients (Group 2) were followed conservatively. The aim of this study is to compare the treatment period of the misdiagnosed surgically treated (Group 1) group and conservatively treated group (Group 2). Lesions were aggravated and delayed healing was observed in Group 1. Diagnosis of Orf disease may sometimes be difficult because of concominant bacterial superinfections and surgical trauma. Careful history and clinical findings point to the correct diagnosis. Contrary to other infections of the hand, surgery can cause further complications in this disease. Conservative treatment is the gold standard, even in complicated cases

	11590339, Orf in urban surroundings and religious practices: a study over a 3-year period]BACKGROUND: Orf is a sheep disease, due to a parapox virus. Men in close contact with these animals may be contaminated. This generally occurs during professional activities. In our clinic, located in the heart of Brussels, we were surprised by the number of orf cases encountered each year, grouped during a short three-week period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We decided to set up a prospective study of three years. Forty-four cases (14 to 64 years of age) were observed: 14 in 1998, 18 in 1999 and 12 in 2000. There were 29 men and 15 women. RESULTS: Only one patient had professional contact with sheep; 42 were muslims. Forty-two lesions out of 44 developed in the same time span, 10 days earlier each year. Complications observed were: erythema multiforme (7 cases), lymphangitis (3 cases), axillary adenitis (3 cases), eyelid edema (2 cases), generalized maculopapular eruption (2 cases) and contact dermatitis to the cream applied (1 case). DISCUSSION: This peculiar epidemiology can easily be explained: patients are contaminated during a religious feast, Aid el Kebir (the Feast of Sacrifice). On this occasion, they slaughter sheep, which they manipulate with bare hands. Small trauma often occur at that time. We conclude that orf is not only a professional disease but particuliar habits may cause epidemic-type contamination

	11676616, ubversion and piracy: DNA viruses and immune evasion.During the co-evolution of viruses with their vertebrate hosts, the DNA viruses have acquired an impressive array of immunomodulatory genes to combat host immune responses and their hosts have developed a sophisticated immune system to contain virus infections. In order to replicate, the viruses have evolved mechanisms to inhibit key host anti-virus responses that include apoptosis, interferon production, chemokine production, inflammatory cytokine production, and the activity of cytotoxic T-cells, natural killer cells and antibody. In addition, some of the viruses encode cytokine or chemokine homologues that recruit or expand cell numbers for infection or that subvert the host cellular response from a protective response to a benign one. The specificity of the viral immunomodulatory molecules reflects the life cycle and the pathogenesis of the viruses. Herpesviruses achieve latency in host cells by inducing cell survival and protecting infected cells from immune recognition. This involves interference with cell signal transduction pathways. Many of the viral immunomodulatory proteins are homologues of host proteins that appear to have been pirated from the host and reassorted in the virus genomes. Some of these have unique functions and indicate novel or important aspects of both viral pathogenesis and host immunity to viruses. The specific example of orf virus infection of sheep is described

	11730927, etection of cellular cytokine mRNA expression during orf virus infection in sheep: differential interferon-gamma mRNA expression by cells in primary versus reinfection skin lesions.In sheep infected with the parapoxvirus orf virus, primary infection orf skin lesions developed and resolved within 8 weeks. Reinfection lesions were smaller and resolved within 3 weeks. The host response in the skin was characterized by an accumulation of neutrophils, dendritic cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells and T19+ gammadelta T cells. The magnitude of this accumulation paralleled orf virus replication in the skin. In situ hybridization was used to detect cells expressing interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) mRNAs in orf skin. Cells expressing IL-4 mRNA were not detected at any time after infection. Cells expressing IFN-gamma mRNA were detected after reinfection but not after primary infection. Cells expressing TNF-alpha mRNA included epidermal cells, vascular endothelium and uncharacterized cells that increased more rapidly in the skin after reinfection compared to primary infection. The results are consistent with a prominent role for IFN-gamma in the host immune response controlling the severity of the disease

	11744431, olymerase chain reaction for laboratory diagnosis of orf virus infections.BACKGROUND: The orf virus of sheep and goats is one of several zoonotic parapoxviruses. In the ovine/caprine host it causes contagious ecthyma (contagious pustular dermatitis, scabby mouth), but in humans it normally causes solitary or clustered orf lesions, typically on hands, arms or face. In addition to disease in the animals, the virus can be quite a nuisance as an occupational hazard in farmers and butchers. Clinical diagnosis is often possible, but laboratory diagnosis is sometimes necessary. For virus isolation, primary ovine or bovine cells, not routinely present, are needed. Serological methods exist, but electron microscopy is the most commonly used method. OBJECTIVES: To develop a reliable method for the laboratory diagnosis of orf zoonoses, without virus culture and without access to an electron microscope. STUDY DESIGN: A suitable primer pair was designed for orf polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using the Oligo software and sequence information from GenBank. Orf positive controls and specimens were kindly provided by several public health centers. Molluscum contagiosum specimens were provided by a dermatologist. HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV positive swab specimens came from our routine diagnostic service. Asymptomatic skin specimens were obtained from sheep heads from the abattoir, and swab specimens from the heads of asymptomatic sheep. Selected amplified orf PCR positive specimens were sequenced to ensure the authenticity of the PCR products. Orf positive specimens were sent to another laboratory for electron microscopy. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A robust PCR was developed, with very small inter-run variation. All specificity demands were met, and the sensitivity seems to be good or excellent. All negative specificity controls from cell cultures and non-orf viruses were negative. Twenty-two (95.7%) of 23 scab or swab specimens with suspected orf etiology were orf PCR positive. Five of eight skin specimens from sheep heads from the abattoir were positive, and all 11 swab specimens from asymptomatic sheep were negative. Electron microscopy demonstrated orf-like particles in orf-PCR positive specimens. This PCR seems to be suitable as a diagnostic test for orf in humans, but asymptomatic virus shedding in sheep or goats may complicate veterinary applications of the assay

	11872419, iant orf on the nose.Ecthyma contagiosum, or orf, is a viral zoonosis of sheep and goats that can be transmitted to humans. In humans, it generally manifests as a solitary skin lesion, although rarely it can have an unusual course or be accompanied by systemic symptoms or complications. We present a case of giant orf lesion on the nose of a 9-year-old. The lesion grew rapidly and measured 5 cm by 4 cm and was attached to the right ala nasi by a base 2 cm round in diameter. The diagnosis was suggested by clinical and histopathologic appearance and confirmed by electron microscopic visualization of the virus. The lesion resolved spontaneously with minimal scarring and the entire cycle lasted about 3 months

	12072264, e>Orf virus immuno-modulation and the host immune response.Orf virus encodes a range of immuno-modulatory genes that interfere with host anti-virus immune and inflammatory effector mechanisms. The function of these reflects the pathogenesis of orf. The orf virus interferon resistance protein (OVIFNR) and virus IL-10 (vIL-10) inhibit interferon production and activity. In addition the vIL-10 suppresses inflammatory cytokine production by activated macrophages and keratinocytes. The virus GM-CSF inhibitory factor (GIF) is a novel virus protein that binds to and inhibits the biological activity of GM-CSF and IL-2. Together, these immuno-modulators target key effector mechanisms of host anti-virus immunity to allow time for virus replication in epidermal cells

	12297324, mmunity and counter-immunity during infection with the parapoxvirus orf virus.Orf virus is a DNA parapoxvirus that causes orf, an acute debilitating skin disease of sheep, goats and humans. In sheep, a vigorous immune response involving neutrophils, dermal dendritic cells, T cells, B cells and antibody is generated after infection. CD4(+) T cells, IFN-gamma and to a lesser extent CD8(+) T cells are involved in partial protection against infection. In spite of this, orf virus can repeatedly infect sheep albeit with reduced lesion size and time to resolution compared to primary infection. This is due at least in part to the action of virus immuno-modulator proteins that interfere with host immune and inflammatory responses. These include: an interferon resistance protein; a viral orthologue of mammalian IL-10 (vIL-10) that is an anti-inflammatory cytokine; and a novel inhibitor of the cytokines GM-CSF and IL-2 (GIF). The virus also encodes a virulence protein that is an orthologue of mammalian vascular endothelial growth factor. The study of the immuno-modulator proteins provides an insight into disease pathogenesis and important elements of a host protective response. This information will be used to devise a rational disease control strategy

	12376759, haracterisation of immunodominant protein encoded by the F1L gene of orf virus strains isolated in Italy.We analysed the molecular properties of the immunodominant protein of different orf virus strains isolated in Italy. The F1L encoding genes and the deduced amino acid sequences of all strains were determined and compared, and they showed several mutations. Structural analysis was carried out in order to assess the influence of amino acid variations on protein structure demonstrating a conservation of the secondary structure. Western blot analysis and immunogold electron microscopy showed that all orf virus strains were antigenically identical. The results of our study confirmed the immunogenicity of the F1L protein; furthermore, our data suggest a possible involvement of the protein in the virus cycle

	12596667, tudy on skin diseases in sheep from northern Ethiopia.A study was conducted to determine the cause and prevalence of skin diseases in local sheep from northern Ethiopia. Of 520 sheep examined 174 (33%) had skin diseases of different causes. The identified causes were lice infestation due to Damalina ovis and Linognatus africanus (21%), sheep pox (8%), sarcoptic mange (Sarcoptic Scab. var. ovis) (4%), dermatophilosis due to Dermatophilus congolensis (3%), and orf (contagious ecthyma) (3%). There was no statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05) association of any of the skin diseases with age and sex of the sheep examined. The occurrence and spread of the diseases were associated with poor management, climatic factors, feed scarcity and inadequate veterinary services. The increasing threat of skin diseases to the development of sheep production warranting an urgent control intervention is indicated

	12658338, Ecthyma contagiosum (Orf) as an uncommon differential diagnosis of infections of the hand]Orf of the hand is considered as an uncommon viral infection which is usually acquired through contact with infected sheep and goats. Indirect infections through contaminated knives or meat have been reported. Many authors feel that the disorder is more common than reported because the disease is often misdiagnosed and the course is usually self-limiting with spontaneous healing within several weeks. Diagnosis is mainly made by patient's history and clinical course. It is important to know the benign nature of human orf, since complications seem to be caused by overtreatment

	12729092,  case of human orf contracted from a deer.Orf, or contagious ecthyma, is a rare viral dermatosis caused by a member of the genus Parapoxvirus. The typical lesion consists of solitary or multiple papules that progress through a series of stages, terminating in complete resolution. This zoonotic disease is most commonly transmitted to humans from infected sheep or goats. We report a case of human orf, likely contracted from exposure to deer carcasses

	12782365, haracterization of a North American orf virus isolated from a goat with persistent, proliferative dermatitis.The characterization of an orf virus (OV) isolated from skin lesions of a goat kid with severe, persistent, proliferative dermatitis, and designated orf virus-San Angelo 2000 (OV-SA00) strain, is described. The identity of OV-SA00 was confirmed by a combination of methods, including electron microscopy, amplification of specific fragments of viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction, restriction enzyme analysis of viral DNA and gene sequencing. Restriction endonuclease analyses of viral DNA and the protein profile studied by Western blot revealed differences between OV-SA00 strain and the profiles of other OV strains that have been published. The restriction enzyme profile of OV-SA00 was also different from the orf virus vaccine (OV-V) strain used to vaccinate this kid. Comparison of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences indicated that OV-SA00 is closely related to OV-V strain, the Scottish OV strains orf11 and MRI Scab, and the human OV-CE/Shoe strain and more distant to bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV) reference strain and the pseudocowpox virus (PCPV)-MNV/Till strain. These results indicate that OV-SA00 is a strain of OV rather than a different parapoxvirus. Further studies are necessary to determine if the severity of orf-induced lesions in this goat kid was the result of individual host susceptibility factors

	15019099, enetic characterization of orf viruses isolated from various ruminant species of a zoo.In the present study, an outbreak of proliferative dermatitis in musk ox (Ovibos moschatus), Sichuan takin (Budorcas taxicolor tibetana) and domestic Shetland sheep (Ovis aries) in a zoo is described. Skin lesions consisted of severe, persistent, multifocal, proliferative dermatitis in musk ox, and mild, transient, focal, dermatitis in the Sichuan takin and Shetland sheep. Parapoxviruses were isolated from skin lesions, and characterized by restriction enzyme analysis and partial gene sequencing. The results of this investigation indicate that the outbreak of proliferative dermatitis was due to infection by a single parapoxvirus, which is genetically closely related to other orf virus (ORFV) strains but distant to bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV) and pseudocowpox virus (PCPV)

	15129568, Three patients with orf (ecthyma contagiosum)]Orf was diagnosed in three patients: a 16-year-old Moroccan girl who had cut her finger in a butcher's shop, a 47-year-old Dutch woman who had allowed a lamb to suck on her finger on a children's farm, and a 50-year-old Dutch farm woman. Orf or ecthyma contagiosum is a well-known viral disease among sheep and goats. Transmission to humans as a zoonosis is rare but can take place via direct contact with infected animals or animal products. The clinical picture is usually characterized by a solitary lesion that develops on the dorsal side of the fingers or hands. This viral condition produces little or no systemic complaints and the lesions usually regress spontaneously without scar formation within 6 weeks (range 4-9 weeks). The correct diagnosis can usually be made on clinical grounds. The diagnosis may be confirmed by demonstration of the virus by electron microscopy or the polymerase chain reaction in fluid obtained from the skin lesions or by conventional histopathology. Early clinical recognition and knowledge of this benign, self-limiting viral condition is vital to avoid unnecessary surgical intervention. Proper information and reassurance of the infected patient are very important. All three patients recovered

	15160866, wan-neck deformity and paresthesia following giant orf.Orf is a zoonotic infection caused by a parapoxvirus that primarily infects sheep and goats. Human orf infection can take place when abraded skin comes into contact with infected animals. It occurs most commonly on the index finger. The characteristic lesion resembles a tumor and resolves spontaneously, usually without any complications. However, rare complications such as lymphangitis, adenitis, erythema multiforme, erysipelas, papulovesicular eruption, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, and bullous pemphigoid have been reported. Herein, we report a case of giant orf causing swan-neck deformity and paresthesia. These complications have not been previously reported in the literature

	15646056, iagnosis of orf virus infection in humans by the polymerase chain reaction.The orf virus is the causal agent of contagious ecthyma in goats and sheep. The infection can be transmitted to humans and represents a typical example of occupational zoonosis. In Italy, the incidence of human infection remains uncertain because the disease is rarely reported or diagnosed. In this paper, we report a case of human orf virus infection and the laboratory methods of diagnosis. We demonstrated a genomic identity between the conserved and the variable regions of the genome of the viral strains isolated from the human patient and from the infected sheep confirming that there is no specific clone infecting humans rather than animals

It is transmitted to humans through contact with infected sheep and goats and is reported as an occupational disease. We report nine cases of human orf seen in the hands of individuals, who were not occupationally exposed, after the feast of sacrifice in Turkey. Three cases were teachers and six out of the nine were housewives. We observed musculoskeletal complications and misdiagnoses. It is important to consider human orf in the differential diagnosis of hand lesions to prevent overtreatment and complications

	16143041, haracterisation of parapoxviruses isolated from Norwegian semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus).BACKGROUND: Two outbreaks of the disease contagious ecthyma were reported in 1999 and 2000 in Norwegian semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus). Contagious ecthyma is an epidermal disease of sheep and goats worldwide, which is caused by the zoonotic parapoxvirus orf virus. Characterisation of clinical samples from the two outbreaks in semi-domesticated reindeer in Norway by electron microscopy and PCR (B2L) revealed typical parapoxvirus particles and partial gene sequences corresponding to parapoxvirus, respectively. If contagious ecthyma in reindeer is caused by orf virus, the virus may be transferred from sheep and goats, via people, equipment and common use of pastures and corrals, to reindeer. Another possibility is that contagious ecthyma in reindeer is caused by a hitherto unclassified member of the parapoxvirus genus that circulates among reindeer herds and remains endemic in Norway. RESULTS: Genomic comparisons of one standard orf strain (orf NZ2) and the reindeer isolates, employing restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, demonstrated high similarity between the reindeer viruses and known orf virus strains. Partial DNA sequences of two different viral genes were determined for the different isolates and compared with corresponding parapoxvirus genebank sequences. The comparison/alignment and construction of phylogenetic trees also point to an affiliation of the reindeer viruses to the species orf virus. CONCLUSION: The results of this work imply that the parapoxvirus causing contagious ecthyma in Norwegian semi-domesticated reindeer belongs to the species orf virus and that the orf virus crosses the host species barrier from sheep and goat to semi-domesticated reindeer

In the first experiment, this was deposited into the duct of teats with orf (Group A, n=5) or papilloma (Group B, n=3). In the second, teats were chapped and then, the organism was deposited into the duct (Group C, n=7) or on the skin (Group D, n=4). Ewes with healthy teats were controls (Group E, deposition into duct, n=5; Group F, deposition on skin, n=2). The ewes in Groups A, B or C developed clinical mastitis 5 h later, whilst the ewes in Group D developed it 2 d later; no control ewe developed clinical mastitis. In ewes with teat lesions, the organism was isolated from secretion samples and the California Mastitis Test became positive 5 h after challenge; neutrophils and lymphocytes were seen in Giemsa-stained secretion films from Group A or B ewes, whilst macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes in films from Group C or D ewes; neutrophils were predominating in films from Group E or F ewes. Inside the teats of Group A, B, C or D ewes, folds, hyperaemia and mucosal thickness were seen; histologically, subepithelial leucocytic infiltration was seen. In Group A or B ewes, no evidence of lymphoid tissue at the teat duct-cistern border was found. In Group C or D ewes, intense erosion and ulceration of the teat skin and conspicuous lymphoid tissue at the teat duct-cistern border, were evident; lesions characteristic of haemorrhagic mastitis were in the mammary parenchyma. In control ewes, subepithelial leucocytic infiltration in the teat duct and lymphoid tissue as above, were evident. We postulate that teat lesions can be predisposing factor to mastitis, by adversely affecting defences and speeding the process of infection and making it more severe

	16386383, n vitro activity of VEGF-E produced by orf virus strains isolated from classical and severe persistent contagious ecthyma.Proliferative orf virus infections in adult sheep have increased in Italy in the past few years: these extreme cases are frequently fatal and difficult to differentiate from other infectious diseases of sheep such as blue tongue. A probable explanation for the proliferative and highly vascularized nature of the lesions was found in the expression of the VEGF-E gene encoded by the orf virus. To investigate a possible role of the viral VEGF in the pathogenesis of severe persistent orf virus lesions, the activity of four VEGF-E variants was compared by an angiogenesis in vitro model. Similar angiogenic activity was found between strains isolated from the classical and the proliferative forms of the disease, even if the latter was able to develop a higher number of vessels during the first 24 h of infection. Our in vitro findings seems to exclude that the VEGF variants encoded by the strain isolated from the atypical form of the disease could be the responsible for the histopathological aspect of the proliferative lesions

	16428161, apid improvement of human orf (ecthyma contagiosum) with topical imiquimod cream: report of four complicated cases.Orf is a zoonosis caused by an epitheliotropic DNA parapox virus. Human orf is a generally benign, self-limiting condition that usually regresses in 6-8 weeks without specific treatment. However, it may be accompanied by local symptoms including pain, pruritus, lymphangitis and axillary adenitis, or less frequently by systemic symptoms such as fever or malaise. Furthermore, it may be complicated by erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erysipelas, generalized mucocutaneous eruption, toxic erythema, eyelid oedema and giant, persistent or recurrent lesions in immunocompromised patients. Imiquimod, a potent topical immune response modifier, enhances both the innate and acquired immunity by stimulation of immune system cells resulting in local antiviral, antitumour and immunoregulatory activity. We present, for the first time, four complicated cases of orf successfully treated by topical imiquimod resulting in rapid regression of both orf and associated lesions. Two of the cases were complicated with erythema multiforme, one with recurrent eyelid oedema, and another had giant orf associated with axillary lymphadenitis. We suggest that topical imiquimod may be an effective and safe therapy for complicated orf cases

	16430972,  real time PCR assay for the detection and quantification of orf virus.A real time quantitative PCR assay based on TaqMan technology was developed for orf virus (ORFV) DNA quantification in clinical samples, infected cells and organotypic cultures. This method was based on the amplification of a 70 bp fragment from the ORFV B2L gene (orthologue of the Vaccinia virus Copenhagen F13L gene) that encodes the major envelope protein. Both intra- and inter-assay variability were well within +/-0.25 log(10) S.D. showing the high efficiency and reproducibility of the assay. The TaqMan PCR was subsequently used to determine the titre of several batches of the ORFV strain NZ-2, with it being possible to quantify virus solutions in the range of 1 x 10(1) to 1 x 10(6) TCID(50)/ml. A good correlation between the titre determined by the TaqMan PCR and by conventional endpoint dilution was found. The PCR assay is reproducible and can be used for a rapid quantification of ORFV in vitro and ex vivo, being readily achievable within 1h

	16437055, e>Orf virus infection in humans--New York, Illinois, California, and Tennessee, 2004-2005.Orf virus is a zoonotic parapoxvirus endemic to most countries in the world and is principally associated with small ruminants (e.g., sheep and goats). Human orf infections appear as ulcerative skin lesions after contact with an infected animal or contaminated fomite. This report summarizes the epidemiologic and laboratory investigations of four sporadic cases of human orf infection, emphasizing the temporal association between human lesions and skin trauma or recent flock vaccination with live orf vaccine. This zoonotic infection shares clinical manifestations and exposure risks with other, potentially life-threatening zoonoses (e.g., cutaneous anthrax) and is likely under-recognized because of a lack of clinical suspicion and widely available diagnostics. Barrier precautions and proper hand hygiene are recommended for the prevention of orf virus infection in humans

	16514336, e>Orf virus infection and host immunity.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A summary of recent advances in our knowledge of the biology of orf virus is presented to illustrate the interaction of a zoonotic pathogen with host skin. This is providing novel and interesting data on the viral mechanism of skin infection and the host response. RECENT FINDINGS: The full genome sequences of two parapoxviruses (orf virus and bovine papular stomatitis virus) have recently been published, defining the parapoxvirus genus at the molecular genetic level. This, along with more detailed characterization of viral immuno-modulatory proteins, is providing an insight into the acquisition of host genes and the mechanism of pathogenesis. A new chemokine-binding protein has been discovered with unique features. Structure-function analysis of the viral granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor inhibitory factor has revealed a similarity to type 1 cytokine receptors. The viral vascular endothelial growth factor-E stimulates angiogenesis in the skin without the side effects seen with cellular vascular endothelial growth factor-A, and may have therapeutic potential. Finally, orf virus is proving useful both as an immuno-modulator and as a vector for the expression of foreign antigens in non-permissive species. SUMMARY: Orf virus infection provokes a vigorous skin immune response. However, the virus has acquired a range of immuno-modulatory/pathogenesis-related genes that function to limit (at least transiently) the effectiveness of host immunity. With the advent of the orf virus genome sequence, the study of this dynamic process will provide important insights into virus pathogenesis and the host skin immune response to infection

In this study we present the results of different treatment regimens in lambs experimentally infected with orf virus with different cidofovir formulations prepared in Beeler basis and Unguentum M. Our results show that choice of excipient, concentration of codofovir [corrected] and treatment regimen were all important to the clinical outcome of the therapy. Whilst one particular regimen appeared to exacerbate the lesion, treatment with 1% (w/v) cidofovir cream, prepared in Beeler basis, for 4 consecutive days did result in milder lesions that resolved in milder lesions that resolved [corrected] more quickly than untreated lesions. Furthermore the scabs of the treated animals contained significantly lower amounts of viable virus meaning there should be less contamination of the environment with virus than would normally occur

	17184854, n vitro evaluation of the anti-orf virus activity of alkoxyalkyl esters of CDV, cCDV and (S)-HPMPA.Acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs) and in particular (S)-1-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]cytosine (HPMPC, cidofovir, CDV, Vistide) and its adenine counterpart (S)-9-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine [(S)-HPMPA] are highly active against orf virus infections. This parapoxvirus commonly causes infection in sheep, goats, but also humans. Alkoxyalkyl esters of CDV have an increased oral bioavailability and are more active against orthopoxviruses than the parent compounds. In the present study, the potency of several alkoxyalkyl esters of CDV, cyclic cidofovir (cCDV) and (S)-HPMPA was evaluated against different orf virus isolates in two cell types, human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblast and primary lamb keratinocytes. Each prodrug was at least 10-fold more active than its parent compound in both cell types. Of all the compounds tested, the (S)-HPMPA alkoxyalkyl esters showed the highest activity and selectivity against orf virus. Our results support the development of alkoxyalkyl esters of ANPs as antivirals not only for the treatment of complicated human orf lesions, but also in the therapy and prophylaxis of contagious ecthyma in sheep and goats

	17185014, he development of oral lesions in lambs naturally infected with orf virus.Stomatitis in sheep caused by orf virus can be confused with lesions of more economically significant diseases, including foot-and-mouth disease, but there is no published account of the sequential development of oral orf lesions in the sheep. This report describes the clinical appearance of such lesions during a natural outbreak of the disease in young lambs. Lesions were seen on the gingiva, the tongue and the dental pad/hard palate, and progressed from small erythematous papules to larger, often coalescing papules that in some cases were ulcerated. Resolution started within seven days and was complete within 22 days. The lambs continued to suck and thrive throughout the infection. Lesions at all stages were proliferative, providing a major differentiating factor between orf and other causes of stomatitis in sheep

	17524510, ajor amino acid sequence variants of viral vascular endothelial growth factor are functionally equivalent during Orf virus infection of sheep skin.Orf virus infection causes a contagious pustular dermatitis characterized by extensive vascular changes that have been linked to a virally encoded vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The VEGF genes of different strains of orf virus can vary extensively in amino acid sequence. Functional analyses of two major variant VEGF proteins derived from orf virus strains, NZ2 and NZ7, have revealed quantitative differences in biological activities and receptor binding specificities suggesting that these viral VEGFs could have different roles in the pathology of orf virus infection. In this study, we show that both orf virus strains express equivalent levels of the viral VEGF variants and during infection of sheep skin induce comparable levels of vascularization, edema, epidermal rete ridge and scab formation. Recombinants of orf virus NZ2 and NZ7 strains in which the variant VEGF genes were disrupted showed markedly reduced vascular changes and evidence of partially attenuated viral growth. These results demonstrate that despite substantial differences in sequence and biological activity in vitro, these virally expressed virulence factors are functionally equivalent in their natural host, contributing equally to orf virus pathology

	17554023, nfection with recombinant orf viruses demonstrates that the viral interleukin-10 is a virulence factor.Orf virus is the prototype parapoxvirus that causes the contagious skin disease orf. It encodes an orthologue of the cytokine interleukin (IL)-10. Recombinant orf viruses were constructed in which the viral interleukin-10 (vorfIL-10) was disabled (vorfIL-10ko) and reinserted (vorfrevIL-10) at the same locus and compared to wild-type virus for their ability to induce skin lesions in sheep. After either primary infection or reinfection, smaller less severe lesions were recorded in the vorfIL-10ko-infected animals compared with either of the vorfIL-10-intact virus-infected animals. Thus, the vorfIL-10ko virus was attenuated compared with the vorfIL-10 intact viruses, demonstrating that orf virus IL-10 is a virulence factor. The virus IL-10 is one of several virulence or immuno-modulatory factors expressed by orf virus. Removal of any one of these genes would be expected to have only a partial effect on virulence, which is what was observed in this study with vorfIL-10

	17627446, seudocowpox virus: the etiological agent of contagious ecthyma (Auzdyk) in camels (Camelus dromedarius) in the Arabian peninsula.We have determined the nucleotide sequence of DNA extracted from pustules, saliva, and blood of camels presenting with contagious ecthyma, in Bahrain and also from a sample (SACamel) of infected tissue from a camel that had presented with contagious ecthyma in 1998 in Saudi Arabia (1). Sequence homologies and phylogenetic analysis showed that this extracted DNA was more closely related to Pseudocowpox virus (PCPV) than Orf virus (ORFV), which infects sheep, goats, and other animal species. The phylogeny also demonstrated that PCPV in Arabian camels was phylogenetically distinct from, and circulates independently of, ruminant-associated PCPV from Europe

	17682935, dentification and phylogenetic analysis of orf virus from goats in Taiwan.An outbreak of contagious ecthyma in goats in central Taiwan was investigated. The disease was diagnosed by physical and histopathologic examinations, and the etiology of the disease was identified as orf virus by electron microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequence of major envelope protein (B2L) gene. The entire protein-coding region of B2L gene were cloned and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of B2L amino acid sequences showed that the orf virus identified in this outbreak was closer to the Indian ORFV-Mukteswar 59/05 isolate. This is the first report on the molecular characterization of orf virus in Taiwan

	17768017,  severe outbreak of contagious ecthyma (orf) in a free-ranging musk ox (Ovibos moschatus) population in Norway.During July-October 2004, 19 (18 calves, 1 yearling) free-ranging musk oxen (Ovibos moschatus) at Dovre, Norway, were observed with contagious echtyma-like lesions, and 16 of them were euthanized. Six musk oxen were subjected to necropsy, histopathological and microbiological examinations. All euthanized animals had lesions consistent with contagious ecthyma presenting as wart-like, scabby lesions on the muzzle, lips, oral mucosa and limbs to a variable extent. The histopathological examination showed pustular dermatitis characterized by epidermal proliferation, reticular degeneration, degenerating keratinocytes with intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies, vesicopustules, microabscesses and multifocal ulcerations in the epidermis which was covered by a serocellular crust. Pathology and bacteriology showed evidence of secondary infections in the skin and draining lymph nodes. Electron microscopy (negative staining) of lesions from four animals detected parapoxvirus with the typical arrangement of the outer protein filaments. Parapoxvirus DNA was detected in tissue samples from two examined animals by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers from the B2L-gene. A DNA sequence of 326 nucleotides from the amplicon was compared with similar DNA sequences from parapoxvirus isolated from sheep, reindeer, musk ox and cattle. The outbreak was caused by a virus similar to other circulating orf virus variants in Norway. Antibodies against parapoxvirus were detected with a virus neutralization test in 3 of 35 musk oxen (8.6%) sampled at Dovre between 2004 and 2006. This is the first report of a severe outbreak of contagious ecthyma in free-ranging musk oxen

	17912086, nusual presentation of human giant orf (ecthyma contagiosum).Giant orf is a zoonotic infection that is endemic in sheep and goats. It may be transmitted to humans by direct contact with infected animals or contaminated objects and is typically found on the hands. We report the case of a sheep farmer with facial orf that proliferated dramatically with the formation of satellite lesions after curettage

	17919774, e>Orf-induced immunobullous disease: A distinct autoimmune blistering disorder.BACKGROUND: Many complications have been reported after orf infection, including lymphadenopathy, secondary bacterial infection, and erythema multiforme. Rare associations with papulovesicular eruptions, including a bullous pemphigoid-like eruption, have also been described. OBJECTIVES: Our purpose was to clinically, histologically, and immunologically characterize two cases of orf-induced blistering disease, and to determine whether this condition represented a novel disease entity distinct from known immunobullous diseases. METHODS: Two patients were clinically described and skin biopsy specimens were collected for routine histology, direct immunofluorescence studies, and polymerase chain reaction analysis to detect orf viral DNA. Patients' sera were assessed for autoantibodies by indirect immunofluorescence studies using normal-appearing human salt-split skin, by Western blot analysis using keratinocyte extracts, dermal extracts, and recombinant type VII collagen, and immunoprecipitation studies of extracts from biosynthetically radiolabeled human keratinocytes. RESULTS: Two distinctive cases of severe, diffuse blistering eruptions after orf infection are described. In one patient, orf virus DNA was detected in the inciting orf lesion, but not in blistered skin, ruling out disseminated orf infection as a cause of the blisters. In both cases, histology revealed subepidermal blisters with mixed inflammatory cell infiltrates containing neutrophils and eosinophils, direct immunofluorescence microscopy studies demonstrated IgG and C3 deposited at the dermoepidermal junctions of perilesional skin, and indirect immunofluorescence studies demonstrated circulating antibasement membrane IgG that bound the dermal side of salt-split skin. Extensive immunoblot and immunoprecipitation studies failed to reveal a consistent, identifiable autoantigen. LIMITATIONS: We describe only two cases. The autoantigen recognized by circulating autoantibodies was not identified. CONCLUSIONS: Orf-induced immunobullous disease is a unique disease entity that is clinically and immunologically distinct from bullous pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, and other known immunobullous conditions

	18201239, cthyma contagiosum (orf)--report of a human case from the United Arab Emirates and review of the literature.BACKGROUND: Ecthyma contagiosum (orf) is caused by an epitheliotropic parapox virus. It is a zoonosis usually transmitted to humans from affected sheep or goat through direct contact or contaminated fomites. METHODS: We report a 36-year-old patient with multiple skin lesions on his left hand, first observed 5 days before admission followed by red streaks on the forearm and an erythema on the upper arm 1 day prior to admission. The patient reported that he was working on a sheep farm. RESULTS: Histopathologic examination showed evidence of a viral infection. Subsequent transmission electron microscopy showed typical parapox virus particles, predominantly in the scaled-off layers of degenerated keratinocytes and monocytes. The results were verified and specified by two newly established polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and subsequent sequencing of the amplicons: one broadly reacting 'general parapox virus PCR', and one assay which allows--following sequencing--discrimination between individual orf virus strains. CONCLUSION: Despite the multiplicity of the lesions, there was a significant improvement after 2 weeks of treatment. Sequencing showed the uniqueness of this virus compared with previously published strains from other countries

	19381838, herapeutic paint of cidofovir/sucralfate gel combination topically administered by spraying for treatment of orf virus infections.The aim of the research was to study a new cidofovir/sucralfate drug product to be used as a spray for treating the mucosal and/or skin lesions. The product, i.e., a water suspension of sucralfate (15% w/w) and cidofovir (1% w/w), combines the potent antiviral activity of the acyclic nucleoside phosphonate cidofovir ((S)-1-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]cytosine) and the wound healing properties of sucralfate gel (sucrose octasulphate basic aluminum salt). The product was characterized in vitro with respect to compatibility between drug and carrier, spray particle size, spray deposition, drying kinetics, and drug content and release. An interaction between the two active substances was found. The interaction between sucralfate and cidofovir was counteracted by introducing sodium dihydrogen phosphate (16% w/w) in the preparation. The spray formulation containing cidofovir/sucralfate gel painted the skin and dried quickly to a scab, remaining firmly adhered to the lesions. The therapeutic paint was tested in vivo on lambs infected with orf virus by treating the animals with different cidofovir/sucralfate formulations (0.5% or 1% cidofovir + sucralfate 15% + NaH(2)PO(4) 16% w/w) and with sucralfate gel suspension alone as control. The treatment with formulations containing cidofovir and phosphate salt for four consecutive days resulted in a rapid resolution of the lesions, with scabs containing significantly lower amounts of viable virus when compared with untreated lesions and lesions treated with sucralfate suspension alone

	19387592, Expanding papillomatous nodule on forearm with acute lymphangitis. Case of diagnosis]Ecthyma contagiosum (orf) is a dermatosis commonly seen in those in contact with sheep. It is caused by Parapoxvirus ovis (orf virus), an oval epitheliotropic DNA parapox virus. The skin disease develops in stages starting as a macule or papule, becoming nodular, and then regressing. Diagnosis is based on history and histology, as well as identifying the virus through cell culture or specified polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The treatment of this self-limited disease is usually symptomatic

DNA sequence analysis of the A32L genes of these and isolates from other countries showed sequence heterogeneity (base pair variation and deletion) in the 3'-terminal regions. This finding led to the development of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for the rapid differential diagnosis of orf virus infections, and the results demonstrated that this was an easy and reliable method for genotyping of orf viruses

	19413907, etection and phylogenetic analysis of Orf virus from sheep in Brazil: a case report.BACKGROUND: Orf virus (ORFV), the prototype of the genus Parapoxvirus (PPV), is the etiological agent of contagious ecthyma, a severe exanthematic dermatitis that afflicts domestic and wild small ruminants. Although South American ORFV outbreaks have occurred and diagnosed there are no South American PPV major membrane glycoprotein B2L gene nucleotide sequences available. CASE PRESENTATION: an outbreak of ovine contagious ecthyma in Midwest Brazil was investigated. The diagnosis was based on clinical examinations and molecular biology techniques. The molecular characterization of the virus was done using PCR amplification, cloning and DNA sequencing of the B2L gene. The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a high degree of identity with ORFV strains, and the isolate was closest to the ORFV-India 82/04 isolate. Another Brazilian ORFV isolate, NE1, was sequenced for comparative analysis and also showed a high degree of identity with an Asian ORFV strain. CONCLUSION: Distinct ORFV strains are circulating in Brazil. This is the first report on the phylogenetic analysis of an ORFV in South America

	19443300, eneralized parapoxvirus infection associated with increased antibody titres for varicella zoster virus and measles.Human parapoxvirus infections are rare, self-limiting, zoonotic diseases. A 35-year-old veterinarian presented with a generalized rash of large umbilicated vesicles that appeared after antibiotic treatment for erysipelas on the forearm. The erysipelas arose from an erupted pustular thumb lesion that appeared after examining a sheep. An outbreak of chickenpox in the village suggested parapoxvirus or varicella zoster virus (VZV) was the most likely agent. No poxvirus was detected by electron microscopy or in cell cultures from lesion material. PCR revealed parapoxvirus DNA with a sequence similar to orf-viruses from Finland. Orf-virus immunofluorescence showed a titre increase, supporting the parapoxvirus diagnosis. VZV was not detected by PCR, but varicella antibodies increased three-fold in serum samples drawn two weeks apart. In addition, the patient had high antibody titres for measles and reported recent contact with individuals exposed to an outbreak of measles in nearby Austria. To explain the unusually generalized symptoms in this young and healthy patient, these findings could be variously interpreted as: i) a booster by community VZV infections; ii) a subclinical VZV (re)infection that was superinfected by the parapoxvirus; iii) an orf-virus mediated immune stimulation; iv) a post-infectious syndrome; or v) a temporary immunosuppression by subclinical measles

	19735227, e>Orf: an update on current research and future perspectives.Orf is one of the most widespread viral diseases worldwide, affecting mostly small ruminants and, sometimes, other species, including wild animals. Of late, there have been an increasing number of reports of new species being affected by the disease, implying a dynamic host-pathogen interaction. The causative agent, orf virus, has been extensively investigated over recent years, owing to its zoonotic importance and ability to cross-infect other species sporadically. The evasive mechanisms that the virus has developed to adapt and grow in the presence of an active immune response helps to explain the ability of the virus to repeatedly reinfect the same host. The apparent diversity in the antigenic/immune targets of different orf virus strains involved in such repeat infections may also be contributing factors. Exposure of animals to stress or immunosupression as a result of therapy or primary viral infection can accentuate the severity of disease. Genes homologous to host cytokines or their antagonists, and which contribute to viral virulence, have been found in the viral genome. A combination of electron microscopy, histology and PCR is the most accurate laboratory approach for confirmation of the disease, although clinical signs are often typical. However, some infections may be confounded by similar clinical manifestations caused by other infections. This review presents, in brief, a recent understanding of the virus at the host-pathogen level, molecular biology of the virus, disease epidemiology, clinical manifestations in man and animals, diagnostic procedures, and the economic and environmental impact of the disease

	19769160, The cloning, expression and structural analysis of putative unknown protein Orf 9b in SARS-CoV]Orf 9b was amplified by PCR from SARS-CoV genome and cloned into the Nco I and Bam HI sites of the pET32c expression vector, and then recombinant plasmid pET32c-Orf 9b was constructed. The recombinant fusion protein Orf 9b was expressed by IPTG induction and purifed. After being cleaved by rEK, Orf 9b protein with MW 11 kD was separated and collected. It was demonstrated by ELISA that the purified Orf 9b protein could react with sera of SARS rehabilitaion patients but not with sera from healthy donors. CD and Infrared spectroscopy were used to predict the secondary structure of the purified Orf 9b protein. The distribution percentages for the the secondary structures of alpha-helix, beta-sheet, and random coil in the Orf 9b protein estimated by CD were 12.5%, 40%, and 47.5%, respectively, while the same parameters estimated by Infrared spectroscopy were 13.7%, 47.5%, and 37.9%, respectively. The results obtained by the two methods were substantially identical and showed that the structure of the Orf 9b protein consisted mostly of beta-sheet, and comprised only few alpha-helix. The acquisition of purified protein and the structural information presented herein may provide foundation for further functional study

	19927769, Orf of the hand]INTRODUCTION: The orf is a zoonotic infection which can be transmitted to humans. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our report is to describe this often misdiagnosed viral infection in a man with an orf of the hand appearing after the feast of the sacrifice. CASE REPORT: A 40-year-old man with no past medical history, presented with a nodular lesion on the fifth right finger evolving for 3 weeks which had appeared 2 weeks after the feast of the sacrifice. Histology showed a vacuolar degeneration of keratinocytes probably of viral origin. Both histological aspect and the contact with sheep, led to the diagnosis of hand orf. Three weeks later the lesion had spontaneously resolved. CONCLUSION: Orf is an infectious mucocutaneous disease due to a parapoxvirus. It is more frequent in professionally exposed persons (veterinary, butchers...). But, in our country, the frequency of the orf increases after the feast of the sacrifice and remains undiagnosed because patients do not consult. The diagnosis may be confirmed by electron microscopy, conventional histopathology or by isolation of the virus by PCR. Information on the benign character of the disease and reassurance of the infected patient are very important because lesion usually resolves spontaneously

	20147406,  novel inhibitor of the NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway encoded by the parapoxvirus orf virus.The parapoxvirus orf virus (ORFV) is a pathogen of sheep and goats that has been used as a preventive and therapeutic immunomodulatory agent in several animal species. However, the functions (genes, proteins, and mechanisms of action) evolved by ORFV to modulate and manipulate immune responses are poorly understood. Here, the novel ORFV protein ORFV024 was shown to inhibit activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, an important modulator of early immune responses against viral infections. Infection of primary ovine cells with an ORFV024 deletion mutant virus resulted in a marked increase in expression of NF-kappaB-regulated chemokines and other proinflammatory host genes. Expression of ORFV024 in cell cultures significantly decreased lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced NF-kappaB-responsive reporter gene expression. Further, ORFV024 expression decreased TNF-alpha-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB-p65, phosphorylation, and degradation of IkappaBalpha, and phosphorylation of IkappaB kinase (IKK) subunits IKKalpha and IKKbeta, indicating that ORFV024 functions by inhibiting activation of IKKs, the bottleneck for most NF-kappaB activating stimuli. Although ORFV024 interferes with activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, its deletion from the OV-IA82 genome had no significant effect on disease severity, progression, and time to resolution in sheep, indicating that ORFV024 is not essential for virus virulence in the natural host. This represents the first description of a NF-kappaB inhibitor encoded by a parapoxvirus

	20416112, iagnosis and phylogenetic analysis of Orf virus from goats in China: a case report.BACKGROUND: Orf virus (ORFV) is the etiological agent of contagious pustular dermatitis and is the prototype of the genus Parapoxvirus (PPV). It causes a severe exanthematous dermatitis that afflicts domestic and wild small ruminants. CASE PRESENTATION: In the present study, an outbreak of proliferative dermatitis in farmed goats. The presence of ORFV in tissue scrapings from the lips was confirmed by B2L gene polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The molecular characterization of the ORFV was performed using PCR amplification, DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the B2L gene. CONCLUSION: The results of this investigation indicated that the outbreak was caused by infection with an ORFV that was closely related genetically to Nantou (DQ934351), which was isolated from the Tai wan province of China and Hoping (EU935106), which originated from South Korea in 2008. This is the first report of the phylogenetic analysis of ORFV from goats in China

	20462159, rastic cutaneous multi-focal orf infection in goats, causing severe dysfunctioning.A flock of 76 goats was struck by orf infection at the Al-Ahsa oasis in eastern Saudi Arabia. The morbidity rate was 89%, while the case fatality rate was 3%. The clinical signs were most severe in three adult goats, which survived, and in two kids, which died of the infection. The lesions were multi-focal and so serious that they prevented the infected goats from seeing, eating, lactating or walking. The virus was isolated in Vero cell culture and a scab suspension was used to experimentally infect susceptible goats. These newly infected animals suffered only mild disease but the orf virus was re-isolated and the goats seroconverted. To the best knowledge of the authors, these were the most drastic orf lesions seen during the last 17 years in goats in Saudi Arabia

	9176868, dder orf infection and its role in ovine clinical mastitis caused by Pasteurella haemolytica.During an experimental study of ovine subclinical mastitis caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci, an outbreak of contagious ecthyma occurred among ewes unvaccinated against parapox virus. The same group of ewes developed a high rate (43.7%) of clinical mastitis caused by Pasteurella haemolytica. The rate of clinical mastitis among ewes vaccinated against parapox virus was very low (3.7%) suggesting that the presence of orf in the unvaccinated ewes was contributing to the high rate of clinical mastitis. An examination of the iron, sodium, potassium and albumin concentration of milk collected from 16 unvaccinated and nine randomly selected vaccinated ewes before experimental infection with coagulase-negative staphylococci or their uninfected control mammary glands indicated significant differences in the iron (p &lt; 0.0001) and sodium (p = 0.01) concentration. Increased iron concentration in the milk may have assisted in the development of udder infection caused by P. haemolytica as iron is easily utilised by this bacterium

	9280386, he immune and inflammatory response to orf virus.Orf virus is a zoonotic, epitheliotropic DNA parapox virus that principally infects sheep and goats. The fact that the virus can repeatedly reinfect sheep has provoked an interest in the underlying cellular, virological and molecular mechanisms for its apparent escape from the host protective immune response. The local immune and inflammatory response in skin and the cell phenotype and cytokine response in lymph analysed around a single lymph node are characteristic of an anti-viral response. An unusual feature is the dense accumulation of MHC Class II+ dendritic cells in the skin lesion. The function of these cells is not known. Orf virus virulence genes and activities have been identified that may interfere with the development of the host protective immune and inflammatory response

	9689744, vine diseases. Orf.Orf virus is an epitheliotropic DNA parapoxvirus with a worldwide distribution that induces acute pustular lesions in the skin of sheep, goats and man. Genetic mapping and sequencing of the orf virus genome have revealed that orf virus has a typical poxvirus distribution of genes, with those essential for viral DNA synthesis, replication and packaging located in the central region, and those involved in virulence concentrated in the terminal regions. The immune and inflammatory response to orf virus infection in the skin and local lymph is vigorous and typical of an anti-viral response, involving CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, interferons and antibodies. In spite of this, the virus can repeatedly infect sheep. Host acquired immunity involving CD4+ T cells and interferons is effective in controlling the extent of viral replication, but does not prevent reinfection. Several virus putative virulence genes have been identified. These are: viral homologues of ovine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); ovine IL-10; vaccinia virus E3L interferon resistance gene; and in addition a viral activity that inhibits the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). These may be responsible for rescuing orf virus, at least temporarily, from host immunity and aiding viral replication in epidermal cells

The enzyme was used to compare the RE profiles of orf virus isolates from 43 outbreaks of orf that occurred in vaccinated flocks between 1988 and 1993; 21 outbreaks yielded wild-type virus, 10 yielded vaccine viruses, three produced both vaccine and wild-type viruses and no clear result was obtained from nine of the outbreaks. From the 21 outbreaks yielding wild-type viruses, 28 orf virus isolates had clear RE profiles and 15 distinct RE profiles were recorded. Usually only one virus type was associated with each outbreak but from two farms, two different wild-type viruses were recovered. No predominant genotype was identified, with four RE profile types being recovered for more than one outbreak. From the more severe form of orf involving the buccal cavities of lambs only wild-type viruses were recovered, with at least four different genotypes being represented
